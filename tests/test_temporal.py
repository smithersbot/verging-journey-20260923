"""The portable temporal value types and their lexical grammar (SPEC-82).

These values are the shared vocabulary between the markdown parser, the projection, and
both search dialects. Two properties carry the whole design and are pinned here:

* Canonical bounds are fixed width, so byte-lexicographic order *is* chronological
  order -- which is what lets one SQL predicate serve SQLite and PostgreSQL alike.
* Dates and instants are separate axes. A date never gains a time of day or a zone, and
  an instant written without an offset is read as UTC -- the same convention the rest
  of the codebase applies to naive datetimes.
