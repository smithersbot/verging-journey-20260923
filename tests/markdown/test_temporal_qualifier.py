"""Parsing and round-tripping SPEC-82 temporal qualifiers on observations.

Three rules shape every test here:

* **One grammar.** `@[kind]<range-literal>` for a precise interval, `@[kind:]<date>`
  for an unquoted point, and `@[kind:]"<date>"` for a quoted one. The kind is optional
  in all three; an unquoted point that omits it must begin with a digit.
* **Silent when it is not time.** If the payload does not read as a date, the token is
  ordinary content and nothing is reported. Prose is full of `@`, and diagnosing every
  one of them would be noise.
* **Diagnostics only where the author plainly meant a qualifier.** An unknown kind, an
  unterminated quote, and an unquoted date the one-token rule truncated are each
  reported, because each one has a fix the message can name.

And in every case a qualifier that was not accepted is **never dropped**: its text
stays in the observation content, so the line indexes and round-trips exactly as it did
before valid time existed.
