"""Every command this codebase tells a user to run must be able to run (#1440 review).

The readiness formatter that `bm status --cloud` renders hardcoded
`bm project index`, which the local reindex refuses for a cloud project. Earlier
guards for the same property were each scoped to the site that prompted them, so
the next sibling site sat outside the boundary.

The domain here is therefore not a command or a branch but **every place in
`src/` that constructs a runnable command**. Commands are built through
`shell_command` or `command_hint`, so the sites are enumerable: this walks the
source for those calls, recovers the literal command each one spells, and
requires any mode-restricted command to come from a site registered as knowing
the project's mode. A new emission site that names a restricted command fails
here until it is either made mode-aware or explicitly justified.
