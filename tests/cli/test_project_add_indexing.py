"""`bm project add` indexes, and readiness says so honestly (#1414).

The reported failure: `project add` registered a project without indexing it, so
every read surface reported an empty project while 25 notes sat on disk, and
`bm status` called that ready because nothing was pending -- nothing had ever
been queued.

These run the real CLI in a pristine HOME, the way `test_fresh_install.py` does.
The bug lived in the seam between the CLI, the API, and the module-level
database, and only a real install puts all three on the same database: the
in-process fixtures give the API an in-memory engine while the index runtime
opens its own from `db.get_or_create_db`, so an in-process test would prove
nothing about this path.
