"""Every remedy `bm project add` prints must work for the project it printed it for.

Four separate reviews found a remedy that did not: wrong for cloud mode, wrong
for a missing config entry, wrong when the name needed quoting, and wrong for
Team workspaces. Each was fixed by choosing a better command for a case someone
had thought of, which is why a fifth kept arriving.

So this stops enumerating cases and covers the matrix instead: project mode x
failing step, for every combination the code can actually reach. For each one it
runs the printed remedy and asserts the command is accepted for that project --
not that the text looks right, which is what let the earlier versions ship.

`test_every_failure_branch_has_a_row` derives the step list from the source, so
a new failure branch added without a row here fails rather than going untested.
