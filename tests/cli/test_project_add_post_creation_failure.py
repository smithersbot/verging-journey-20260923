"""`bm project add` reports creation and its follow-up steps separately (#1414 review).

The project row is durable before the follow-up work starts. Two things went
wrong there in turn:

1. A follow-up failure was reported as "Error adding project", so the user was
   told the add failed and sent back to a command that now refuses with
   "already exists".
2. Once that was split out, every follow-up shared one remedy — `bm project
   index` — which the local-only reindex path refuses outright for a cloud
   project, and which could not repair a failed config write or mkdir anyway.

So the remedy has to follow the step that failed and the project's mode.
