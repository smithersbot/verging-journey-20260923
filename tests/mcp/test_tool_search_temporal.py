"""End-to-end valid-time search through the MCP `search_notes` tool (SPEC-82).

These tests exercise the whole chain the spec's acceptance cases describe: markdown
carrying temporal qualifiers is written through `write_note`, indexed, projected, and
then queried by authored valid time through `search_notes`.

The scenario is the spec's own: one note holding two `[decision]` observations that
disagree about the cache layer, each qualified with the window it was effective over.
Both live in a *single* note on purpose -- that is what makes entity-granular filtering
insufficient and forces the projection to address individual observations.
