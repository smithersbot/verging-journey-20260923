"""Direct unit tests for resolve_project_path_route (#1415, #1421).

The resolver is the single routing seam for the posix tools: '<project>/path'
inputs route by first segment, an explicit project must agree with a path
prefix, and unqualified input refuses instead of defaulting whenever more than
one project is addressable. The local-config tests drive the function
branch-by-branch against configs written through the test ConfigManager; no API
client is involved there because local-config matching never leaves the
process. The cloud section at the bottom stands up a factory-mode session,
where the project list comes from the tenant instead.
