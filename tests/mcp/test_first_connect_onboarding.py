"""Tests for MCP first-connect onboarding (levers 1 & 3).

These cover the changes that help a freshly-connected model orient itself and offer a first
note against an empty knowledge base, without ever writing one unprompted:

- the server `instructions` string (surfaced at the `initialize` handshake),
- the enriched empty-state returns of `recent_activity` (the orientation call) and `search`,
- the `getting_started` prompt.
