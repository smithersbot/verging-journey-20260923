"""Deleting a note must not erase the relations other notes point at it.

Before this fix, deleting note Beta took every relation row aimed at Beta with it --
even though note Alpha's markdown still said `[[Beta]]`. The text asserted an edge and
the graph denied one, so a "find the links that lead nowhere" report came back clean
over a vault full of them. Alpha only got its row back, correctly marked unresolved, if
something happened to re-index Alpha, and nothing schedules that.

`to_id` has always been nullable, and unresolved-with-`to_name`-preserved is the state
the indexer already produces for a link to a note that does not exist yet. These tests
pin the two HTTP delete paths onto that state -- the single-entity delete and the
directory delete -- plus the unique-constraint question that SET NULL raises.
