"""Regression test for issue #940: lost writes on the in-memory SQLite engine.

The in-memory SQLite URL (``sqlite+aiosqlite://``) used to fall back to
SQLAlchemy's StaticPool, which hands the same DBAPI connection to every
concurrently checked-out session. Concurrent asyncio tasks then share one
transaction scope: a rollback issued by one session — scoped_session's
exception handling, or the pool's reset-on-return at checkin — silently rolls
back another session's uncommitted writes. During sync this manifested as a
freshly inserted relation row vanishing without any error, which is how
``test_sync_entity_circular_relations`` failed on CI with
``len(entity_b.outgoing_relations) == 0``.

This test pins the isolation invariant directly: a session that rolls back in
one task must never destroy an uncommitted write of a session in another task.
