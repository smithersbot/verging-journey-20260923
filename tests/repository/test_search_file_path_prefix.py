"""Dialect contract for the search_index file-path subtree filter.

Every test here runs against whichever backend the session is configured for —
SQLite by default, PostgreSQL under BASIC_MEMORY_TEST_POSTGRES=1 — through the
shared `search_repository` fixture. The point is that the two dialects must
agree row for row: a subtree scope that means "specs/ and everything under it"
on one backend and something wider on the other would report an exact total for
a match set the other backend never produces.
