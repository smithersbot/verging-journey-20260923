# CHANGELOG

## Unreleased

### Features

- **#1558**: `QUERY /v2/search/` (and `POST /v2/search/` for clients that cannot send
  QUERY) searches an explicit set of projects in one database with one query. The body
  is the project search body plus `project_ids`, a required list of internal ids the
  caller has already authorized; an empty list answers no rows and there is no way to
  ask for every project. Full-text, vector, and hybrid retrieval run the same reader
  the project route runs, so one project here ranks exactly as its own route does, and
  results are one ranking over the union rather than merged per-project pages. Hits are
  hydrated only from projects in scope. Every search result, on both routes, now
  carries `project_id` and `project_external_id`.

- **#1558**: `search_notes(search_all_projects=True)` runs one scoped query per database
  instead of one search per project, so a local vault with many projects is one
  query, and each cloud workspace is one query, with results attributed to their
  project by the server rather than by which request they came back on. A new
  `projects` parameter searches a chosen subset by name or external id; an unknown
  name is an error. Cross-database results are still merged by score, one failing
  database is skipped with a warning and an inexact total, and a retryable outage
  or a server too old to attribute its results fails the whole page.

- **#1558**: Vector retrieval reads only the projects in scope and fills the window it
  asks for. The sqlite-vec table gains a `project_id` partition key, so a scoped
  nearest-neighbour query ranks each project's own vectors instead of taking the k
  nearest across the whole database and discarding the out-of-scope ones, which
  could leave a small project with an empty page for a query its notes answered.
  Existing local storage is carried into the partitioned table without re-embedding.
  On Postgres the nearest-neighbour statement now runs on the HNSW index (its
  tie-break sort keys had kept the planner on an exact scan of every vector), with
  `hnsw.ef_search` sized to the candidate window and an iterative scan that keeps
  going until the scope and manifest filters have admitted enough rows. That scan
  needs pgvector 0.8 or later; an older extension is reported as a dependency error
  instead of quietly returning short windows.

- **#1558**: A vector or hybrid search with structured filters (note types, dates,
  categories, metadata, path prefixes, valid time) now fills its candidate window.
  The vector index ranks by similarity alone, so a window taken straight from it and
  filtered afterwards could hold few admitted rows while more sat just past it, and
  the page came back short although matches existed. The reader re-reads the window
  with a bounded geometric overfetch until it holds enough admitted rows, the ranking
  is exhausted, or its tail falls below the similarity threshold. Unfiltered searches
  read their window once, as before.

- **#1512**: Word, PowerPoint, and CSV files get the same sidecar Markdown note a
  PDF gets. `bm import document <path>` indexes the project, extracts the file,
  and writes `<file>.<ext>.md` next to it plus a run note under
  `document-ingestion-runs/`, all through the existing parser-neutral document
  contract. Office formats run through Microsoft's `markitdown` converters
  (`basic-memory[documents]`) inside the same killable, byte-capped worker
  process as pdf-inspector; CSV renders a bounded stdlib preview with strict
  UTF-8. Re-running is a no-op while the source is unchanged, and the command
  refuses to overwrite a hand-written or enriched note at the sidecar path.
  PDF keeps pdf-inspector and works through the same command.

- **#610**: The manual's SYNOPSIS blocks are now generated from the tool registry.
  `just man-regen` renders the MCP call on every section-3 page from the schema
  clients actually receive (required parameters first, then defaults, in schema
  order) and a test holds the shipped blocks byte-equal to the rendering -- change
  a tool signature without regenerating and CI points at the fix. Those pages
  declare `generated: registry`; curated sections stay hand-owned. The manual also
  gains `basic-memory-diagnostics(3)`, closing the one gap between the section-3
  corpus and the tool registry.

- Notes are readable as MCP resources. Every `memory://` URL Basic Memory hands out
  now answers the standard `resources/read`: `memory://<project>/<path>` returns the
  note's raw markdown, frontmatter included, with the identifier accepted as a
  permalink, title, or file path. Unknown notes point at `search_notes`; binary files
  point at `read_content`. `memory://man/...` keeps answering as the manual and
  `memory://<workspace>/<project>/info` as project info, whichever template the
  server matches first.

- **#610**: The manual ships in the package and is served over MCP. The 21 section-3
  pages (one per MCP tool -- `search-notes(3)`, `write-note(3)`, ...) now live in
  `src/basic_memory/man/man3/` as canonical, portable notes. The MCP server exposes
  them as resources: `memory://man` is the index and `memory://man/<page>` is a page,
  with every page also listed as a concrete resource so clients that browse
  `resources/list` see each one with its summary. Page references parse the way people
  and models actually write them -- `search-notes(3)`, `3/search-notes`,
  `search_notes`, `man3/search-notes.md` -- and the server instructions point agents at
  a tool's page before first use. `bm man <topic>` prints a page as Markdown and
  `bm man list` is apropos; `bm man install` is unchanged.

- **#1259**: `write_note` now tells the caller when a freshly created note looks like
  notes that already exist. On a server with semantic search enabled, a create probes
  the vector index with the new note's title and opening content and appends a
  "Similar existing notes" section listing the closest matches, phrased as a question
  -- did you mean to write to one of these? -- with the ways out spelled out: merge
  into the existing note with `edit_note` and delete the new one, link the two with a
  relation, or ignore it. JSON output carries the same list as `similar_notes`. No
  similarity scores are shown and nothing is overwritten on the caller's behalf: on the
  default embedding model a near-duplicate and a merely related note score in the same
  band, so the decision stays with the agent, which has the context the score does not.

### Bug Fixes

- **#1514**: Markdown path links resolve against the note's own path at resolution
  time, the way wikilinks do, instead of at parse time from the file's location
  on disk. The parser had derived the note's project path with `relative_to` on the
  filesystem path, which raised for content parsed from anywhere outside the project
  root (a hosted note read from object storage, for one) and gave a wrong base for
  any other temporary location. The graph now stores the path as authored
  (`../guides/Guide.md`, `./same.md`, `/root.md`); both resolvers turn it into a
  project path from the source note, and background resolution keys path targets
  by their source note. Wikilinks spelled `[[../x.md]]` or `[[./x.md]]` resolve
  by the same rule.

- **#1558**: `search_notes(search_all_projects=True)` and `projects=[...]` rank merged
  full-text hits by score strength instead of raw value. SQLite bm25 scores are
  negative with lower meaning better, so sorting raw values put the weakest hit first
  and cut every page from the wrong end of the ranking; page two repeated page one.
  Every hit on a page that spans projects now carries `project` (JSON) or a
  `- project:` line (text), so the next call can be routed to the right project.

- **#1458**: A note whose file stem equals its project's name is now readable by its bare
  identifier. `split_project_permalink_prefix` matches a leading path segment against a
  project's permalink via `generate_permalink`, which drops file extensions -- so a single
  segment like `moby-dick.txt` in project `moby-dick` collapsed to the project's own
  permalink with an empty remainder, and `cat`/`find` refused it as "names a project, not a
  note" instead of resolving the note. A prefix claim that would leave no remainder now
  requires the raw segment to spell the permalink exactly, extension included; a claim that
  still has a remainder after it is unaffected, since project names never carry a real
  extension in that position.

- **#1437**: An observation and a relation can no longer collide in the search index.
  A relation's permalink is `from/type/to` with the type authored by the user, so a
  note that says `- [decision] redis` and `- observations [[decision/redis]]` gives
  both rows the identical address; Postgres raised an `IntegrityError` on write, and
  SQLite -- whose FTS5 table has no unique index to object -- kept both under one
  address, then dropped one of them on the next single-row index pass. Nothing
  surfaced either way. The search index's uniqueness now includes
  the row kind, which the table's own primary key already carried, so the two rows
  stay separately addressable. **This ships an Alembic migration** replacing
  `uix_search_index_permalink_project` with `uix_search_index_permalink_type_project`
  on Postgres; no permalink changes and no data is dropped on upgrade, and SQLite's
  FTS5 index needs no schema change.

- The `memory://{workspace}/{project}/info` resource is now actually readable over
  `resources/read`: it returned a Pydantic model, which the resource runtime rejects
  (`contents must be str, bytes, or list[ResourceContent]`), so every served read
  failed. It returns the validated response as JSON text now. Found by the new
  note-resource tests, which read through a real client session instead of calling
  the handler directly.

- **#1344**: Deleting a note no longer erases the relations pointing at it. The
  `relation.to_id` foreign key is now `ON DELETE SET NULL` rather than
  `ON DELETE CASCADE`, and `Entity.incoming_relations` no longer cascades deletes
  through the ORM. Deleting a target leaves its inbound relations in the unresolved
  state the indexer already produces for a link to a note that does not exist yet --
  `to_id` null, `to_name` holding the source's original link text -- so a
  broken-link report stops coming back clean over a vault full of them, and
  recreating the target re-links the references through the existing
  forward-reference pass. `from_id` keeps `CASCADE`: an entity does own the
  relations it declares. Rows already lost to the old behavior stay lost; re-index
  the affected notes to bring them back as unresolved.

### Fixes

- **#1451**: A markdown file whose leading `---` block is not a YAML mapping (a letterhead between
  horizontal rules) is now indexed as plain markdown instead of being dropped. The parser
  already treated such a block as body; the indexer separately saw fences, tried to write
  a permalink into them, hit the "refusing to update malformed frontmatter" guard, and
  excluded the file while readiness reported idle. The guard stands: the file is never
  rewritten, and `remove_frontmatter` no longer strips such a block from search content.
  Frontmatter is now classified once, by the parser, as present, absent, or
  malformed, and only the first two are ever written to.

### Internal

- **#1558**: Search filter compilation now runs over an explicit `ProjectScope` instead of
  a repository-bound `project_id`. FTS term preparation and filter compilation moved out
  of the SQLite and Postgres repositories into `sqlite_search_query` and
  `postgres_search_query` as pure functions returning a `CompiledFilter`, and the filters
  both backends share (scope, permalink, directory, item type, category, note type,
  `after_date`, valid time, candidate keys) are compiled once in `search_filters`. The
  note-type and valid-time predicates match search rows on their full
  `(project_id, ...)` identity. Project repositories call the compilers with a scope of
  one; no query behavior changes. First step of the shared single/multi-project reader.

- **#1558**: Full-text execution leaves the project repositories. `SQLiteFts` and
  `PostgresFts` run a compiled statement for any `ProjectScope` and own their engine's
  failure semantics (FTS5 syntax errors answer empty, Postgres retries a malformed strict
  tsquery relaxed inside a savepoint). `SearchRepositoryBase.search` and `count` are
  concrete: shared vector/hybrid dispatch, then the engine's `FtsBackend`. The base read
  path binds every statement to the repository's scope (manifest hydration, candidate row
  fetch, readiness and drop classification). `PreparedSearchQuery` moves to the repository
  layer with defaults, and the filter helpers both backends share move from the base into
  `search_filters`. No query behavior changes.

- **#1558**: Retrieval leaves `SearchRepositoryBase`. `SearchReader` runs one prepared
  query over one `ProjectScope` in whichever mode it asks for, and `SemanticSearch` owns
  vector and hybrid retrieval (adapter lookup, manifest hydration, the structured filter
  pass, score fusion, reranking, pagination) over a `VectorRetrieval` that is present or
  absent rather than probed with `hasattr`. The repository keeps what only it knows
  (whether semantic search is enabled and its vector tables exist) and builds a reader
  per call from its current state. Hydrated chunks are a typed `HydratedChunk`, which
  retires the `best_distance` compatibility branch and the per-backend
  `_distance_to_similarity` hooks the adapters had already replaced. Test doubles
  construct the pipeline directly instead of subclassing the repository. No query
  behavior changes.

- **#1558**: Vector adapters are bound to the database, not to a project. `VectorIndexScope`
  is the database namespace plus embedding schema; every write names the project it
  touches (`upsert(project_id, ...)`, `delete(project_id, ...)`,
  `delete_entity(project_id, ...)`, `delete_orphans(project_id, ...)`) and `search` takes
  a `ProjectScope`, so one sqlite-vec or pgvector adapter answers a query across any set
  of projects with one statement. Milvus keeps a collection per project and searches the
  collections in scope. `SemanticSearch` passes its scope through, so a project
  repository's vector search is unchanged. No query behavior changes.


## v0.23.2 (2026-08-25)

Patch release fixing case-duplicate folder creation.

### Bug Fixes

- **#1326**: `write_note` and `move_note` no longer create case-duplicate
  folders (`schemas/` beside an existing `Schemas/`). When a requested
  directory is not an existing folder but matches exactly one existing folder
  case-insensitively, the note lands in the existing folder — nested paths
  resolve per segment; unknown folders are still created as given, and
  existing case-variant siblings keep today's exact behavior. Folders are
  resolved from the indexed database paths, so local and cloud runtimes
  behave identically, and content-only note updates skip resolution entirely.
  `move_note` reports the actual landing path on a case-corrected move
  instead of a false failure, while a basename divergence still fails
  honestly.

## v0.23.1 (2026-08-25)

Fast-follow patch to v0.23.0 focused on PostgreSQL search parity and a
search-destroying reindex bug. Postgres now indexes complete note bodies for
full-text search (previously only titles and capped content stems, unlike
SQLite), and the per-project search reindex no longer wipes every other
project's search rows in the same database. Also adds a `#bm:links_to`
directive for disambiguating prose wiki-links, and hardens `bm update` output
after in-place upgrades.

### Features

- Added the `#bm:links_to` directive: ending a list item with `#bm:links_to`
  forces the reference to the implicit `links_to` relation, so a single-token
  prose prefix (`- Mother [[Alice]] #bm:links_to`) is not parsed as an
  explicit relation type. The directive stays in the source file but is
  stripped from indexed observation and relation content.

### Bug Fixes

- PostgreSQL full-text search now covers complete note bodies. Note content is
  indexed as bounded, overlapping chunks in a new `search_index_fts_chunks`
  table (a migration backfills existing notes), so deep content matches on
  Postgres the way it always has on SQLite FTS5. The work includes correct
  Boolean AND/NOT semantics across chunk boundaries, apostrophe and
  punctuated-operand handling (`can't`, `v0.13.0b2`, `auth-service`),
  metadata-filter composition, 100+ operand queries, and candidate
  preselection so both GIN indexes stay in play.
- The per-project search reindex (`POST /search/reindex`) no longer drops the
  shared `search_index` table. Dropping it destroyed every project's search
  rows in the same database — and on Postgres nothing outside migrations
  recreates the table, so cloud tenants lost search entirely until manual
  repair. The rebuild now deletes only the reindexed project's rows (chunk
  rows cascade), and the chunks migration recreates a missing `search_index`
  so databases hit by the old behavior migrate cleanly.
- **#1316**: `bm update` status output no longer crashes after an in-place
  upgrade removes the running install's files: rich's deferred Unicode width
  table is preloaded before upgrading, and status lines fall back to plain
  output instead of failing a completed update.
- **#1323**: `bm doctor` no longer fails when `BASIC_MEMORY_PROJECT_ROOT`
  points at an existing project's directory. Doctor now asks the server for a
  disposable `doctor-*` project under the configured root — the only
  sanctioned exception to the nested-project guard — and cleanup deletes the
  project's directory along with its registration.
- `bm doctor` waits for deferred note materialization before verifying the
  API-written file, matching the accepted-write contract instead of racing it.

## v0.23.0 (2026-08-23)

Semantic search grows up and concurrent writes stop deadlocking. Search gains
opt-in cross-encoder reranking, pluggable vector indexes with a first-party
Milvus adapter, and a batch of embedding-correctness fixes; the indexing and
persistence path is rebuilt around generation-versioned, compare-and-swap
writes so concurrent multi-agent workloads can no longer deadlock or lose
observations and relations. Day-to-day operation gets a real front door with
`bm config`, Rich `bm tool` output, a diagnostics tool, an honest reindex,
and a retrieval inspector — `bm inspect chunks` shows a note exactly as the
index sees it and `bm inspect query` traces how a search ranked its results;
`bm hook` brings harness lifecycle capture into the package; and cloud adds
`bm cloud share`, `bm cloud prune`, an optional Redis read cache, and Team
workspace `bm cloud push`/`pull` over permissioned WebDAV. Five database
migrations run automatically on first start, including a one-time repair
that dedupes duplicate observation rows and purges their stale full-text
search entries.

### Breaking Changes

- **#1111**: The `canvas` MCP tool is removed, along with the API resource
  write endpoints that backed it (**#1106**). Obsidian canvas generation is
  no longer available.
- **#1145**: The `cloud_info` and `release_notes` MCP tools are removed.
- **#1121**: Pre-v0.18.0 legacy HTTP API routes are dropped (**#1116**).
  Old clients still calling them now get 404s.
- **#1035**: The ChatGPT-compatibility `search`/`fetch` tools now refuse
  non-OpenAI MCP clients with a clear rejection; other clients should use
  `search_notes`/`read_note` instead.
- **#1061**: One-way `bm cloud sync` now deletes newly-`.bmignore`d files
  from the cloud instead of leaving them there forever (**#1032**).
  Intentional, but destructive relative to prior behavior — review your
  `.bmignore` before the first mirror after upgrading.
- **#1002**: `bm status` is redesigned around project index status; scripts
  that scraped the old sync-report output will break. As part of this, the
  config keys `sync_delay`/`sync_changes` are renamed
  `index_delay`/`index_changes` — legacy config.json keys and
  `BASIC_MEMORY_SYNC_*` env vars are auto-migrated, no action needed.
- The `sync_thread_pool_size` and `sync_max_concurrent_files` config keys
  are removed with no alias and are silently ignored if present; the closest
  replacement knob is the new `materialization_workers` setting.
- **#1240**: `bm reindex --embeddings` now exits nonzero when entities fail
  to embed, surfaces the failures, and reports which index identity it wrote
  (**#1237**). Wrappers that relied on unconditional exit 0 must handle real
  failures.
- **#1063**: `edit_note`'s `replace_section` is heading-level-aware and now
  replaces nested subsections by default instead of silently preserving
  content past the next heading; pass `replace_subsections=false` for the
  shallow behavior (**#1012**).
- **#1082**: `list_directory` results are bounded and paginated (**#1048**).
  Consumers expecting one exhaustive listing must page.
- **#1198**: The MCP server now runs on FastMCP 4.0.0b1 and MCP SDK v2 — a
  beta framework release. Downstream embedders pinning FastMCP 3.x must
  upgrade together.

### Features

- **#1143**: Opt-in cross-encoder reranking of vector/hybrid search
  candidates (**#950**, **#618**, **#666**): `reranker_enabled` (default off) with a
  local FastEmbed ONNX reranker or LiteLLM API rerankers (Cohere, Jina,
  Voyage), plus candidates, timeout, char-cap, and API tuning knobs.
- **#1141**: Pluggable semantic vector indexes on Postgres (SPEC-81):
  `semantic_vector_index` selects `pgvector` (default) or `milvus`, and a
  new index identity/readiness manifest lets vector search tell "no ready
  index" from "no results". SQLite keeps sqlite-vec. After switching
  backends, run `bm reindex --embeddings`.
- **#1158**: First-party Milvus, Milvus Lite, and Zilliz Cloud vector index
  adapter via `pip install basic-memory[milvus]`; existing collections
  reload after restart (**#1185**), with identical rankings verified across
  sqlite-vec, pgvector, and Milvus Lite.
- **#1043**: LiteLLM embeddings accept a custom `api_base` and direct
  `api_key` for OpenAI-compatible and self-hosted servers (**#1005**), and
  literal document/query prefixes support prefix-sensitive asymmetric
  models (**#1044**, **#1008**).
- **#1249 / #1250**: New retrieval inspector (**#1155**). `bm inspect
  chunks <note>` shows a note exactly as the index sees it — its search
  rows, the vector chunks each row produced, and per-chunk
  ready/pending/stale/orphaned status — separating chunking problems from
  freshness problems in one command. `bm inspect query "<query>"` captures
  an opt-in execution trace from the same search call that returns the
  results: FTS and vector candidates, fusion, filtering, reranking, and the
  final page window, with stable JSON output and `--show-misses` for
  rejected candidates. Ordinary search behavior and responses are
  unchanged.
- **#1088**: New `bm config` command group: `list` (effective values with
  env overrides marked), `get`, `set` (validated through the config model),
  and `unset` (**#991**).
- **#967**: Interactive `bm tool` commands render Rich panels, tables, and
  trees on a TTY, with a `cli_output_style` setting and per-invocation
  `--plain`/`--json` overrides; piped output stays machine-readable
  (**#678**).
- **#963**: New `basic_memory_diagnostics` MCP tool reports version and
  system info for bug reports (**#187**).
- **#1018**: The local Postgres backend is usable end to end: migrations,
  connection pooling, and default-project resolution.
- SQLite write-path tuning is exposed via new `sqlite_synchronous`,
  `sqlite_mmap_size`, `sqlite_wal_autocheckpoint`, and `sqlite_page_size`
  settings.
- **#1100**: `created`/`modified` frontmatter timestamps are honored as note
  timestamps (**#238**). Recency ordering can change after the first
  re-sync for notes carrying historical dates.
- **#1079**: Notes written through the API/MCP persist their observations
  and relations immediately instead of waiting for the next file re-index
  (**#1076**).
- **#1227 / #1220 / #1228**: Persistence is generation-versioned with
  compare-and-swap publication — a stale indexing pass can never clobber or
  deadlock against a newer write, so observations and relations stay intact
  under concurrent agent write load (**#1224**, **#1213**, **#1214**).
- **#1204 / #1132 / #1131**: Relation resolution and vector prepare work are
  batched instead of serial, and a new `materialization_workers` setting
  (default 4) bounds concurrent write materializations.
- **#1165**: Relation-derived search refreshes are durable, retryable work
  items (**#1163**), pending relations refresh from accepted content
  (**#1161**, **#1159**), and forward references back-resolve when their
  target note is created, without a full reindex (**#1015**).
- **#1070**: Added the `bm hook` harness front door (SPEC-55, **#997**).
  Lifecycle verbs (`session-start`, `pre-compact`, `stop`) move plugin hook
  logic into the package behind per-harness stdin adapters. Default-on
  bounded envelope capture records lifecycle metadata into a local inbox
  WAL; `bm hook flush` archives it locally, `bm hook status` shows the
  surface, and `captureEvents: false` disables capture. `bm hook install` /
  `bm hook remove` wire hooks into user-level harness config for standalone
  users with ownership-tagged, surgical merging. The Claude Code and Codex
  plugin hooks are now zero-logic PEP 723 uv scripts invoking
  `basic-memory hook` in-process, with `BM_BIN` overriding the uv-managed
  environment for development.
- **#1119**: Plugins surface hook capture setup and health (**#1117**), and
  Claude Code hook config falls back to user-level `~/.claude` settings
  (**#924**).
- **#1123 / #1138 / #1142 / #1147**: Codex hooks and memory notes are
  reliable, checkpoints are authored and prompted after compaction, and
  checkpoints are directly resumable.
- **#1124 / #1126 / #1050**: New skills: `bm-writing` with coding setup,
  `bm-decide`/`bm-orient`, and the shared `memory-onboarding` skill; coding
  session profiles are queryable (**#1125**).
- **#965**: New `bm cloud share` command group: `create`, `list`, `update`,
  `revoke` (**#880**).
- **#1061**: New `bm cloud prune` removes `.bmignore`d files from the cloud
  on demand (**#1032**; see Breaking Changes for the one-way sync behavior
  change).
- **#1263**: Team-workspace `bm cloud push`/`pull` run over the service's
  permissioned WebDAV surface instead of tenant-wide storage credentials,
  so any member can sync the projects they have access to — previously only
  workspace owners could provision the required credentials and every other
  member got a 403 (**#1262**). Same flags and semantics: `--on-conflict`
  still defaults to `fail`, and transfers stay additive — nothing is ever
  deleted. Requires the updated cloud server, already deployed in
  production; the Personal rclone path is untouched.
- **#1168 / #1172**: Optional Redis read caching accelerates standalone MCP
  reads via the `basic-memory[redis]` extra (`redis_url`,
  `redis_max_connections`) (**#980**).
- **#1255**: Semantic note reads make the minimum number of API requests —
  exact-ID reads skip resolve and resource calls entirely — and ordinary
  read-cache entries live 300 seconds instead of 60.
- **#1062 / #1074**: Cloud project deletion errors are surfaced, with an
  optional notes purge and a visible deletion job (**#1033**, **#1034**).
- **#1145**: First-connect MCP onboarding: server instructions, empty-state
  guidance, and a `getting_started` prompt for new users.
- **#1090**: `edit_note` accepts a `metadata` param to update frontmatter
  fields (**#1011**).
- **#1075**: `move_note` returns the previous accepted path (**#1072**).
- **#1040 / #1101 / #1103**: `external_id` is exposed in `list_directory`,
  `recent_activity`, search results, and `search_notes` markdown output.
- **#1268**: `list_directory` accepts a `sort` parameter (`title_asc`,
  `title_desc`, `updated_asc`, `updated_desc`) with deterministic
  folders-first ordering applied before pagination (**#1267**); omitting it
  keeps the existing filename order.
- **#1031 / #1036 / #1037**: MCP tool annotations are directory-compliant,
  destructive hints are explicit, and `edit_note` exposes its operation
  enum.

### Bug Fixes

- **#1193 / #1202**: Two indexing deadlock families are eliminated:
  Entity/NoteContent lock-order inversions during materialization and
  Entity/Observation inversions between indexing and accepted writes
  (**#1187**, **#1199**, **#1209**).
- A one-time migration dedupes historical duplicate observation rows and
  purges their orphaned full-text search entries (companion to **#1228**).
- **#1247**: Incremental `bm reindex --search` purges stale search-index
  rows whose backing entity, observation, or relation is gone, so DB-only
  search divergence on unchanged files converges without a `--full` rebuild
  (**#1226**; the last loose end of the **#1214** repair).
- **#1152 / #1160**: Moves record a durable vacate marker, so a
  byte-identical copy at the old path indexes as a new note instead of
  being skipped as a lingering move source.
- **#1258**: A note accepted while a project scan is in flight can no
  longer be deleted as "externally removed" — destructive project-index
  deletes re-verify the database lineage and the path's current absence
  from storage at apply time (**#1256**).
- **#1016**: Direct on-disk edits picked up by the file watcher are now
  vector-embedded, so externally edited notes no longer go missing from
  semantic search until a reindex (closed by the vector-sync overhaul,
  **#1129**–**#1131**, **#1141**).
- **#1023**: FastEmbed embeddings are L2-normalized for non-bge models, so
  semantic search no longer silently degrades to FTS-only.
- **#1071**: SQLite full-text search covers complete note content —
  previously content beyond ~6000 characters was invisible (**#1065**) —
  and CJK terms work in the relaxed FTS fallback (**#1022**).
- **#1269**: Full-text query relaxation counts non-Latin tokens, so
  Cyrillic, Greek, Hebrew, Arabic, and other non-Latin queries relax to an
  OR retry instead of silently degrading hybrid search to vector-only
  ranking, and combining marks stay inside their word so Devanagari and
  Thai terms are not shredded into fragments (extends the CJK-only fix from
  **#1022**).
- **#1069**: Unknown semantic/hybrid result totals are explicit in
  structured search responses (**#1068**).
- **#1190**: `bm reindex --embeddings` warns when the project has no synced
  entities instead of silently no-opping (**#1184**).
- **#1196**: A legacy pgvector embeddings schema no longer breaks
  `bm project info` (**#1195**).
- **#1151**: Ambiguous identifier resolution fails loudly instead of
  returning the wrong note (**#1148**), and project-scoped entity
  resolution is separated from cross-project wikilink resolution
  (**#1192**, **#1170**).
- **#1272**: Root-level wikilinks written as filename stems resolve via the
  `.md` file-path fallback, and a forgiving underscore/hyphen/case alias
  resolves links in directly edited vaults — tried only after every exact
  identity, and failing closed when two files collide on the same alias
  (**#1253**).
- **#1189**: Note-type filters are case-canonicalized, so `Person` and
  `person` match the same population (**#1180**).
- **#1081**: `write_note` rejects filename-convention twins (kebab-case vs
  Title Case) instead of creating duplicate notes (**#1077**).
- **#1073**: `edit_note` with a `memory://` URL routes to the target
  project instead of creating phantom notes (**#1066**), and scoped
  `memory://` URL paths are preserved (**#1092**).
- **#1299**: `build_context` bounds its traversal requests — primary pages
  cap at 50 results, related context at 100 per page, and negative
  `max_related` is rejected instead of acting as an unbounded SQL limit —
  so a traversal call can no longer become a multi-megabyte vault export
  (**#1296**). Callers paginate or follow returned `memory://` links.
- **#1285**: Glob-filtered directory listings traverse subdirectories
  again: `file_name_glob` filters results instead of accidentally pruning
  recursion, so `*.md` with depth 2 finds files inside subdirectories.
- **#1188**: Sync preserves malformed frontmatter instead of prepending a
  second frontmatter block that shadows `name`/`description` (**#1171**).
- **#1239**: Timestamp-prefixed transcript lines and checkbox markers
  (`[x]`, `[/]`, `[>]`, `[?]`) no longer mint junk observation categories
  (**#1219**, **#1241**).
- **#1271**: Transcript timestamp ranges like `[24:33.098 - 24:41.260]` no
  longer mint junk observation categories either — the remaining
  range-shaped case from **#1239** (**#1270**).
- **#1291**: Prose bullets no longer mint typed relations: a sentence like
  `- Added [[Target]] to the roster` filed a relation *type* called `Added`
  and silently dropped the rest of the line, including any further links in
  it. An explicit relation now ends at its target or its `(context)`;
  anything else keeps every wikilink as a plain `links_to` edge (**#1260**).
- **#1060**: `schema_validate` with no arguments validates all
  schema-covered types instead of type "unknown" (**#1013**), and invalid
  schema-validation modes are rejected instead of silently degrading to
  warn (**#1223**, **#1222**).
- **#1085**: Re-adding a retained cloud project reindexes its existing
  notes (**#1084**).
- **#1010**: `bm project list` shows configured cloud-mode projects even
  when uncredentialed (**#1003**), and deleting the default project
  auto-reassigns the default instead of refusing (**#1139**).
- **#1273**: Re-selecting the project that is already the default no longer
  clears the default flag — a state that broke project discovery and every
  project-scoped MCP tool until a default was set again.
- **#1290**: ChatGPT import no longer crashes on conversations missing
  `create_time` — timestamps fall back to `update_time`, then the earliest
  message time, so the whole archive imports (**#1276**); undecodable
  import uploads return a 400 with the parse error instead of a 500.
- **#1298**: The update check no longer reports "up to date" when the
  Homebrew probe fails, no longer auto-runs `brew upgrade` for an update
  inferred from PyPI metadata, and names the actual Homebrew target
  version it will install.
- **#1300 / #1302**: The multilingual-E5 prefix contract is documented —
  asymmetric FastEmbed models need `semantic_embedding_query_prefix` /
  `semantic_embedding_document_prefix`, which already drive reindex through
  the embedding identity — along with custom-model selection, the installed
  FastEmbed catalog, and dimensions (**#1264**).
- **#1058 / #1094**: `bm doctor` never prints a blank failure message, and
  migrations adapt to existing event loops (**#1027**).
- **#1080**: Loading config no longer recreates an empty `~/basic-memory`
  directory as a side effect (**#1029**).
- **#1057**: Large projects no longer crash reindex on SQLite's
  bound-parameter limit (**#1045**).
- **#1218 / #1216**: Windows: the MCP server no longer dies at startup on a
  log-cleanup race (**#1211**), note content no longer crashes log
  formatting during index retries (**#1212**), the watch service no longer
  crashes on mapped network drives (**#1047**), and a PermissionError
  during project scan no longer triggers mass index deletion (**#1007**).
- **#1059 / #1179**: Hermes: `bm mcp` child processes no longer leak
  (**#1017**), and bm subprocesses no longer inherit Hermes's Python
  environment (**#1093**).
- **#1274**: Hermes: commands and skills register through Hermes's own
  registration APIs instead of private PluginManager writes, preserving the
  lifecycle ownership that cleans them up on provider unload (**#1257**);
  the slash-command monkeypatch docs are split by Hermes version so modern
  installs skip the legacy collector workaround (**#1278**), and the install
  docs require a Hermes release with managed manifest-v2 installation
  instead of the nonexistent `--path` option (**#1280**, **#1303**).

### Maintenance

- **#1113 / #1114**: Dependency injection is consolidated behind the v2
  composition roots (**#1109**).
- **#1122 / #1133–#1136 / #1229**: The largest service god-files are split
  into focused modules (**#1108**).
- Removed the hook-specific redaction subsystem, its `detect-secrets`
  dependency, and the retired lifecycle projector compatibility module.
- Kept Milvus as a first-party optional vector backend while removing the
  unused Python entry-point registry for separately packaged vector
  adapters.
- **#1292 / #1293**: The dev-release pipeline publishes again via PyPI
  trusted publishing — its version gate imported a hardcoded module version
  and had silently skipped every dev publish since the 0.22.1 bump.
- **#1304 / #1307**: The concurrent-write convergence benchmark is ported
  into the canonical `/benchmarks` package, and the read-load benchmark
  runs against the current MCP SDK's typed result fields.

## v0.22.1 (2026-06-12)

Follow-up patch to v0.22.0. Fixes project and default-project resolution on
fresh installs, MCP workspace routing, sync project selection, and CLI startup
latency, plus a few MCP parity additions.

### Features

- Added a `workspace` parameter to `write_note` for parity with `edit_note`.
- **#826**: Added `title` and `tags` annotations to all MCP tool decorators
  (phase 1).
- **#930**: `search_notes` now comma-splits `note_types`, `entity_types`, and
  `categories`.
- **#971**: Added the manual-pages flow — manpage seed schema, flow docs, and
  verification fixes.

### Bug Fixes

- Fresh installs no longer fail when the projects table is empty: resolve now
  points them at project setup, the first project is promoted to default when
  the config default is missing from the database, the promoted default state
  is returned from the project-create API, and a default can be set when none
  is currently set. An existing database default is preserved when repairing a
  missing config default.
- **#949**: Sync skips projects without an absolute local path and excludes
  orphan DB projects that are absent from config.
- **#952 / #981**: Resolved workspace display names and tenant ids in qualified
  project routes, closing out the manual verification findings.
- `note_types`/`entity_types`/`categories` are normalized on the direct-call
  path, with non-string list elements rejected.
- Vector-search hydration keys on `(type, id)` to prevent id collisions.
- `file_utils` requires line-anchored frontmatter fences.
- CLI startup is faster: FastAPI and app imports are deferred out of CLI
  startup, and rich/typer modules are preloaded before an in-place upgrade.
- `config.json` is written atomically.
- In-memory SQLite sessions are serialized so concurrent rollbacks cannot
  destroy writes.

### Maintenance

- Release recipes route through PRs and wait for the release PR merge to land
  before tagging; the release runbook is refreshed and stripped of
  user-specific absolute paths.

## v0.22.0 (2026-06-11)

Team-safe cloud sync. New additive `bm cloud push` and `bm cloud pull`
commands work safely on shared Team workspaces, while the destructive mirror
commands are gated to Personal workspaces. Also: a large batch of MCP tool
fixes, search improvements, and embedding reliability work.

### Features

- **#917**: Added Team-safe `bm cloud push` / `bm cloud pull`. Both are
  additive (they never delete on the destination) and abort on conflicts by
  default, git-style, with `--on-conflict {fail|keep-local|keep-cloud|keep-both}`.
  The destructive `bm cloud sync` / `bm cloud bisync` mirrors are now gated
  to Personal workspaces.
- **#920**: Team push/pull uses per-workspace rclone remotes, so remotes and
  credentials stay scoped to each workspace.
- **#908**: Search supports an observation category filter.
- **#809**: Added an experimental LiteLLM embedding provider for semantic
  search (marked experimental, see **#899**).
- **#907**: `bm tool write-note` accepts `--type`.
- **#906**: `bm status` accepts `--wait` and `--timeout`.
- Added the `bm tool delete-note` command.
- **#905**: Improved workspace and cloud bisync command discoverability.

### Bug Fixes

- **#931 / #946**: Truncated observation permalinks are disambiguated to
  prevent search-index collisions, and `build_context` resolves observations
  by the same permalink the search index uses (**#909**, **#929**).
- **#934**: `edit_note` recovers when the file exists on disk but is not yet
  indexed (**#581**).
- **#911 / #932 / #941**: Comma-separated tags are split consistently in
  `parse_tags` and the `search_notes` tags parameter, with input normalized
  for direct callers (**#910**).
- **#933**: `read_note` accepts `page`/`page_size` for parity with sibling
  tools (**#883**).
- **#914 / #904 / #916**: `move_note` resolves `memory://` URLs, stops
  falsely rejecting same-project moves as cross-project, no longer reports
  false success across project boundaries, and mismatch guidance points at
  the landing path.
- **#915**: Navigation pagination is validated, and `recent_activity` shows
  the correct project.
- **#913**: `bm tool` commands align with MCP behavior (error exit codes,
  overwrite handling, category support, defaults).
- **#923**: `bm cloud setup` no longer overwrites an existing rclone remote
  (**#922**).
- **#912**: The `note_types` search filter is case-insensitive.
- `build_context` allows cross-project context traversal, `write_note`
  resolves overwrite conflicts, and sync uses strict deferred relation
  resolution.
- Embedding reliability: FastEmbed vectors are L2-normalized (**#843**),
  corrupt FastEmbed model caches self-heal (**#900**), a single embedding
  provider is reused per process (**#903**), `sqlite-vec` loads for the
  embedding-status query (**#901**), and engine disposal no longer crashes
  on the Postgres backend (**#902**).

### Maintenance

- Leaner, faster CI: testmon-selected branch builds, sharded Postgres jobs,
  and faster default test fixtures (**#928**, **#938**, **#945**).
- Documented personal-vs-team cloud sync semantics (**#947**, closes
  **#851**).
- Fixed npx skill install docs (**#927**).
- Added `glama.json` to claim the Glama MCP directory listing (**#953**).

## v0.21.6 (2026-06-04)

Monorepo consolidation plus a redesigned Claude Code plugin. The satellite
repositories now live in the main `basic-memory` tree, and the plugin is
rebuilt as a memory bridge with a guided setup interview, capture skills, and
team workspaces. Codex, Hermes, and OpenClaw integration packages ship
alongside it.

### Core

- Consolidated the Basic Memory satellite repositories into the main
  `basic-memory` tree as the canonical source, discovery, documentation,
  issue, and release home.
- Added root marketplace/package validation for the consolidated repository
  layout.
- Added root and package-local justfile targets so Claude Code, Codex, skills,
  Hermes, and OpenClaw builds can be verified from the monorepo.
- Removed the legacy `ui/` directory.

### API

- Entity resolution now exposes the owning project on resolved entities so
  callers can route follow-up reads to the correct workspace/project.

### CLI

- Added an "auto BM" GitHub CI workflow that captures notes from CI runs.
- Exposed project sync-support metadata and surfaced copyable workspace
  identifiers in project listings.
- `cloud login` now surfaces non-subscription errors instead of masking them.
- Team workspaces block `rclone sync`, with the team-workspace guard limited
  to `bisync`.

### Claude Code

- Rebuilt the Claude Code plugin as a memory bridge with SessionStart and
  PreCompact hooks, a bundled output style, and seeded note schemas.
- Added the `/basic-memory:setup` bootstrap interview and the
  `/basic-memory:remember`, `/basic-memory:status`, and `/basic-memory:share`
  skills.
- Added team workspace support with attribution for shared writes.
- Prefixed plugin skills with `bm-` and installed the shared `memory-*` skills
  instead of duplicating them in the plugin.
- Hooks fall back to `uvx`/`uv` when no CLI binary is on PATH.

### Codex

- Added the Codex plugin under `plugins/codex/` with its native
  `.codex-plugin`, hooks, seeded schemas, and `bm-*` skills.

### Skills

- Added the shared Basic Memory `SKILL.md` collection under top-level
  `skills/` and ported useful retired plugin skills into the `memory-*` set.
- Fixed invalid picoschema enum YAML in the memory skills.

### Hermes

- Added the Hermes memory provider plugin under `integrations/hermes/` with
  its native Python module, `plugin.yaml`, skill, tests, docs, and release
  metadata.

### OpenClaw

- Added the OpenClaw plugin under `integrations/openclaw/` with its native
  npm/TypeScript package shape, tests, docs, and release metadata; skill
  bundling copies from the top-level `skills/` source.

## v0.21.5 (2026-05-26)

Workspace/project routing fixes for MCP, plus a SQLite vector reindex stability fix.

### Bug Fixes

- **#854**: MCP project listing now keeps duplicate cloud project rows distinct by
  workspace, so only the selected workspace row inherits local project state.
- **#853**: `write_note` returns workspace-qualified permalinks for cloud
  workspace writes, allowing follow-up `memory://` reads to route back to the
  correct workspace/project.
- **#852**: Full SQLite vector reindex now loads `sqlite-vec` before dropping
  `vec0` virtual tables, preventing reindex crashes.
- **#838**: Local ASGI database initialization is preloaded so MCP routing can
  safely enter local project contexts.

## v0.21.1 (2026-05-16)

CI-only release. No user-facing changes.

### Maintenance

- **#833**: Replace `mislav/bump-homebrew-formula-action` with an inline
  bash bump step. The action's `resolveRedirect` HEAD-requests
  `api.github.com /repos/.../tarball/<ref>` expecting HTTP 302; GitHub now
  returns 303 for authenticated requests on that endpoint, which broke
  the v0.21.0 Homebrew job and required a manual tap bump. The inline
  step does the same work (curl + sha256sum, clone tap, sed-bump
  `url`/`sha256`, commit, push) without any third-party dependency.

## v0.21.0 (2026-05-16)

Workspace-aware everywhere: every MCP tool and CLI command now routes through the
same workspace/project model, the search and sync paths are noticeably faster,
and a handful of long-standing parsing and routing footguns are gone.

### Breaking Changes

- Relation parsing no longer treats unquoted multi-word text before a wikilink as a
  custom relation type. Use single-token relation types like `relates_to [[Target]]`,
  or quote multi-word relation types like `"relates to" [[Target]]` or
  `'relates to' [[Target]]`.
  - Bare list wikilinks like `- [[Target]]` now index as `links_to`.
  - Prose list items like `- some other thing [[Target]]` now index as `links_to`.
  - To preserve existing multi-word relation types on re-sync, quote them before upgrading.
  - See **#824**.

### Features

- **#816**: `bm orphan` CLI command surfaces entities whose underlying markdown
  files are gone, with a flag to clean them out.
- **#789**: Create projects directly by cloud workspace slug from MCP
  (`create_memory_project(workspace=...)`).
- **#757**: Discover projects across every accessible cloud workspace in MCP's
  project list — no more per-workspace blind spots.
- **#766**: MCP tools accept training-data-friendly parameter aliases
  (`q`/`search`/`text` for `query`, etc.) so models reach for them naturally.
- **#776**: `bm db reset` refuses to run while a `basic-memory mcp` process is
  alive, so resets can no longer corrupt an open session.
- **#791**: Search responses include result totals so pagers can stop guessing.
- **#719**: Cloud `note_content` tenant schema primitive lands on the backend.
- **#715**: `bm project add` accepts a `--visibility` flag for cloud projects.

### Bug Fixes

#### Search and recent activity
- **#832**: SQLite project deletion now sweeps `search_index`,
  `search_vector_chunks`, and `search_vector_embeddings`, so a project that
  reuses a recycled auto-increment id can't inherit the previous tenant's content.
- **#812**: `recent_activity` orders and filters by `updated_at`, so edits bubble
  to the top instead of staying pinned to creation time.
- **#807**: Multi-project `search_notes` is opt-in (`search_all_projects=True`);
  default search stays scoped to the resolved project.
- **#785**: `recent_activity` caps responses and emits an explicit truncation
  footer instead of silently dropping rows.
- **#713**: Eliminated an N+1 query in search result hydration.

#### Workspace / project routing
- **#822**: `bm project list` now includes projects from every workspace, not
  just the current one.
- **#813**, **#808**, **#806**, **#803**, **#801**, **#795**, **#790**, **#778**,
  **#777**, **#722**, **#712**, **#704**: Workspace-qualified permalink routing
  is centralized and applied consistently across `edit_note`, `delete_project`,
  `build_context`, `memory://` URLs, factory-mode project listing, cloud uploads,
  and the API client.

#### Sync
- **#827**: `rclone bisync` filters from `.bmignore` are preserved across syncs.
- **#815**: Watch service ignores hidden paths relative to the watched project,
  not just relative to `$HOME`.
- **#814**: `scan` subprocesses no longer go through the shell, avoiding quoting
  issues with paths that contain special characters.
- **#759**: Watch service stays inside `--project` scope.
- **#746**: Canonical markdown is preserved during single-file sync.

#### Parsing
- **#796**: Picoschema modifier descriptions (`field?(modifier, description)`)
  parse correctly.
- **#769**: Obsidian callout blocks are skipped by the observation parser
  instead of being mis-extracted as observations.

#### CLI
- **#775**: `bm project set-cloud` / `set-local` cleans up local DB state for
  the affected project.
- **#773**: `bm cloud logout` clears `default_workspace`.
- **#780**: `bm cloud setup` hint points at `bm cloud sync-setup`.
- **#734**: `bm project info` shows cloud index freshness.
- **#718**: Private cloud projects display under their `display_name` instead of
  raw UUID.
- **#768**: `read_note` / `view_note` drop no-op pagination params from their
  signatures.

#### Stability
- **#774**: `sqlite-vec` failures during init degrade gracefully to keyword-only
  search instead of crashing startup.
- **#733**: Delete-vector and cloud-sync cleanup is now consistent.
- **#702**: Race conditions in concurrent `delete_entity` are resolved.
- **#724**: `external_id` is preserved when entities are re-upserted during a
  re-index.
- **#728**: Vector init no longer issues runtime `ALTER TABLE`.
- **#744**: `BASIC_MEMORY_CONFIG_DIR` is honored across remaining call sites.
- **#743**: FastEmbed cache lives under the data dir instead of `/tmp`.
- **#752**: Cloud projects report `source=cloud` in factory mode.
- Stripped null bytes from markdown content before DB insert.
- Allowed long `relation_type` values in API responses.

#### Installer
- **#772**: Docker-compose config volume mounts under the `appuser` home.
- **#695**: Bumped `brew outdated` timeout from 15s to 60s.

### Performance

- **#828**: CLI startup no longer pulls in the local ASGI FastAPI app when it
  isn't needed.
- **#751**, **#726**, **#717**, **#714**, single-file/batch indexing: marked
  speedups on the sync hot path; unchanged markdown is skipped entirely.
- **#731**, **#723**: Vector sync is faster on both backends, with tuned
  fastembed defaults.

### Maintenance

- **#825**: Dependency refresh + security hardening.
- Updated to `fastmcp` 3.3.1.
- **#754**: Removed in-house telemetry wrappers in favor of direct `logfire`
  usage.
- **#736**: `ty` is now the default typechecker.
- **#771**, **#770**, **#716**: New regression guards for vector-row cleanup,
  long relation types, and recent activity hydration.

## v0.20.3 (2026-03-26)

### Bug Fixes

- **#698**: CLI cloud commands now use API key when configured
  - `get_authenticated_headers()` only checked OAuth tokens, ignoring `config.cloud_api_key`
  - All CLI cloud commands (`upload`, `status`, `snapshot`, `restore`, etc.) failed for API-key-only users while MCP tools worked fine
  - Now mirrors the same credential priority as MCP: API key first, OAuth fallback
  - Fixes `bm cloud upload --project` returning "project does not exist" when authenticated with `bmc_*` API key

## v0.20.2 (2026-03-10)

### Bug Fixes

- Fix auto-update Homebrew detection: `brew outdated` exits 1 when a formula is outdated, not on error
  - Previously treated exit code 1 as a failure, causing "Automatic update check failed" instead of detecting the available update

## v0.20.1 (2026-03-10)

### Bug Fixes

- **#661**: Fix `bm project list` MCP column to show transport type (stdio/https) instead of DB presence
  - Renamed "MCP (stdio)" column to "MCP"
  - Shows actual routing mode: `stdio` for local, `https` for cloud projects
  - Clears local path display for cloud-mode projects
- **#662**: Invalidate config cache when file is modified by another process
  - Adds mtime-based cache validation to `ConfigManager.load_config()`
  - Long-lived processes (MCP stdio server) now detect external config changes
  - Fixes `bm project set-cloud` having no effect on running MCP server

## v0.20.0 (2026-03-10)

### Features

- **#643**: Default-on auto-update system and `bm update` command
  - Automatic background update checks for CLI installs (uv tool, Homebrew)
  - Install-source detection (homebrew, uv_tool, uvx, unknown) with uvx skip behavior
  - Periodic check gating via `auto_update_last_checked_at` + `update_check_interval` config
  - Manager-specific update flows: Homebrew (`brew upgrade`) and uv tool (`uv tool upgrade`)
  - Silent, non-blocking MCP behavior via daemon thread before server run
  - Manual commands: `bm update` (force check + apply) and `bm update --check` (check only)
  - New config fields: `auto_update`, `update_check_interval`, `auto_update_last_checked_at`

## v0.19.2 (2026-03-09)

### Bug Fixes

- **#657**: Coerce string params to list/dict in MCP tools
  - MCP clients that serialize `list`/`dict` arguments as JSON strings no longer fail Pydantic validation
  - Adds `BeforeValidator` coercion to `search_notes` (`entity_types`, `note_types`, `tags`, `metadata_filters`), `write_note` (`metadata`), and `canvas` (`nodes`, `edges`)
- **#655**: Handle SQLite and Windows semantic search regressions
  - Fix embedding status query for non-semantic SQLite databases
  - Windows-safe log file rotation with per-process log filenames
  - Robust `setup_logging` that handles all environments cleanly

## v0.19.1 (2026-03-08)

### Bug Fixes

- **#649**: Enforce strict entity resolution in destructive MCP tools (`edit_note`, `move_note`, `delete_note`)
  - Prevents fuzzy-match fallback from silently editing/moving/deleting the wrong note
  - DST-related timeframe validation fix (round instead of truncate days)

### Features

- **#648**: Add `insert_before_section` and `insert_after_section` edit operations
- Add `GET /knowledge/graph` endpoint for full graph visualization

### Dependencies

- Bump authlib from 1.6.6 to 1.6.7

## v0.19.0 (2026-03-07)

### Highlights

- **Semantic vector search** for SQLite and Postgres with FastEmbed embeddings
- **Schema system** for validating and inferring knowledge base structure
- **Per-project cloud routing** with API key authentication
- **Upgraded to FastMCP 3.0** with tool annotations
- **CLI overhaul** with JSON output, workspace awareness, and project dashboard

### Features

  - FastEmbed-based embeddings with automatic backfill
  - Hybrid search combining full-text and vector similarity
  - Score-based fusion replacing RRF for better ranking
  - `min_similarity` override for tuning search precision
  - Semantic dependencies are now default, with optional extras fallback

- **#549**: Schema system for Basic Memory

  - `schema_diff` — compare schemas across projects
  - Frontmatter validation support (#597)
  - Read schema definitions from file instead of stale DB metadata (#635)

  ([`cbe72be`](https://github.com/basicmachines-co/basic-memory/commit/cbe72be10a646c0b03931bb39aff9285feae47f9))

This change makes the 'basic-memory project default <name>' command both: 1. Set the default project
  for future invocations (persistent change) 2. Activate the project for the current session
  (immediate change)

Added tests to verify this behavior, which resolves issue #37 where the project name and path
  weren't changing properly when the default project was changed.
