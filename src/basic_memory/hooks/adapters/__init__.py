"""Per-harness hook stdin adapters.

Each harness speaks its own hook JSON dialect; an adapter normalizes it into
``NormalizedHookEvent`` so everything downstream (envelope, archive, CLI) is
harness-agnostic. Adding a harness means adding one small module here plus its
recorded fixtures — nothing else changes.
