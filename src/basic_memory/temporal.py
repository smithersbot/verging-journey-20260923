"""Portable temporal value types for authored valid time (SPEC-82).

Basic Memory authors time as *semantic* data. A `[decision]` that was effective from
June 10 until the July 27 cutover is a statement about the world, not a record of when
the note was edited. This module owns the values that carry such a statement and the
lexical grammar for the range literals authors write.

PostgreSQL's range conventions are the language contract: `[lower,upper)` with explicit
inclusivity per side, unbounded ends, and a distinguished empty range. That is a
vocabulary choice, not a storage requirement -- these values reduce to portable scalars
so SQLite and Postgres can share one logical model. Its *discrete* canonicalization is
part of the contract too: a date range is stored as `[lower,upper)`, for the reason
`TemporalRange` documents. The author's own spelling is not lost -- it is kept verbatim
on `TemporalAssertion.source_text`.

Two canonical lexical forms carry every bound:

    date     ``YYYY-MM-DD``                   (10 characters)
    instant  ``YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.ffffffZ``  (27 characters, always UTC)

Both are fixed width with ASCII digits in fixed positions, so byte-lexicographic order
is chronological order. That is what lets containment and overlap be plain string
comparisons with identical SQL text in either dialect.

The two axes never mix and never convert into one another. A date bound is a calendar
date: it acquires no time of day and no timezone, ever. An instant bound names a moment
and is normalized to UTC, so two instants written in different offsets compare as the
instants they name. A timestamp written without an offset is *read as UTC*, which is
the convention the rest of the codebase already uses for naive datetimes
(`utils.ensure_timezone_aware`, `recent_activity`).

Two authored surfaces reach these values, and they trade precision for convenience in
opposite directions:

* A **range literal** (`[2026-06-10,2026-07-27)`) is the precise form. Its bounds must
  be written in the canonical lexical shapes above, to at most microsecond precision.
* A **point** (`2026-06-10`, `2026-06`, `2026`, `June 10, 2026`) is the convenient form.
  It denotes the span its precision covers, so an author never has to spell out a range to
  say when something started. A point written in ISO calendar syntax is read literally,
  because its text fixes its meaning; any other spelling is read with `dateparser`,
  because there is no literal reading for a guess to contradict. Either way the reading
  must be the same on every pass -- `yesterday` names no fixed span and is refused, for
  the reasons set out above `parse_authored_point`.

    Bounds are canonical lexical strings; `None` means unbounded on that side.
    Construction normalizes three PostgreSQL rules so no caller has to remember them:
    an unbounded side is always exclusive, an interval containing no points *is* the
    empty range, and -- exactly as `daterange` does -- a **date** range is rewritten
    into the half-open `[lower,upper)` form.

    That last rule is what makes the scalar SQL predicate correct rather than merely
    tidy. Calendar dates are a *discrete* domain, so `[a,b]` and `[a,b+1)` denote the
    same set of days, but only the half-open spelling lets endpoint comparisons decide
    membership. Left as authored, `(2026-01-01,2026-01-03)` holds only January 2 and
    `(2026-01-02,2026-01-04)` holds only January 3 -- disjoint sets -- yet each raw
    endpoint lies inside the other's bounds, so a comparison of raw endpoints reports

    Instants are a continuous domain -- no moment is "the next one" -- so an instant
    range keeps the inclusivity the author wrote and is never rewritten this way.

    Canonicalization changes the *stored* spelling, never the set of times: `[a,a]`
    becomes `[a,a+1)`, the one day `a`. What the author typed is not lost; it is kept
    verbatim on `TemporalAssertion.source_text`, which is what serialization replays
    and what a search result quotes back. `__str__` renders the canonical form, and

# --- Which language an authored point is written in ---
#
# An author writes a point in one of two languages, and they come with opposite promises.
# **ISO calendar syntax** is machine syntax: the text fixes the meaning, so it must be read
# literally or refused. **Everything else** -- `June 10, 2026`, `2026/03/04`, `10/07/2026`
# -- is human syntax with no literal reading to contradict, so the flexible reader is
# trusted with it. Trusted to *read* it, that is: what it hands back must still name the
# same span whenever it is asked, which is what refuses `yesterday` further down.
#
# The variants below are what a point can be once that question is settled, and settling it
# *once* is the whole design. Four review rounds went the other way: each added a shape test
# whose failure meant "not my business", so a token that failed the test fell through to the
# flexible reader and the next round found another shape that failed it. Here the classifier
# is total: a token that opens with ISO syntax is an `_IsoDay`, an `_IsoMonth` or a
# `_MalformedIso`, and there is no fourth answer to fall through on.
#
# What that buys is narrower than "ISO-shaped text never reaches the flexible reader", and
# stating it precisely matters, because the loose version is false. An `_IsoDay`'s *trailing*
# text is still read by the flexible reader -- that is what reads `2026-06-10 10:00 AM`, and
# no grammar of clock spellings could. What the classifier settles for good is the *calendar*:
# a head that names no date dies here, and a real one is carried on the variant so the reading
# below can be held to it. The trailing is fenced by two rules instead, and dateparser's answer
# is believed only when both hold. It must come back as a time of day on the day the head names
# -- checked in `_read_iso_day`, against what it *returned*, since a suffix's looks do not say
# what it will do with it. And the text must not spell precision a canonical instant cannot
# carry -- checked here, on the text, because that is the one defect the returned-value check
# cannot see: a truncated fraction still lands on the right day.

# The ISO calendar components a point *opens* with: `YYYY-MM` and an optional `-DD`. A date
# carrying a time (`2026-06-10T14:00`, `2026-06-10 10:00 AM`) is matched on its date part
# alone, because `\d+` cannot cross the separator -- the rest is `trailing`, judged below.
#
# Each component is `\d+` rather than `\d{2}`, and nothing terminates the pattern, so the
# head matches whenever a point opens with ISO syntax at all. Both rules exist because the
# earlier cuts of this guard failed to match a malformed token and so let it escape: against
# `\d{2}` the day of `2026-01-0100` left a trailing `00` and matched nothing, and against a
# trailing `(?![\d-])` lookahead `2026-01-01-` matched nothing. Both reached the flexible
# reader, which is the one outcome ISO syntax must never have.
_ISO_CALENDAR_HEAD = re.compile(r"^(\d{4})-(\d+)(?:-(\d+))?")

# What it takes to be *reaching* for an ISO date, as opposed to naming one. A year and a
# hyphen is a commitment to machine syntax; nothing else is spelled that way. The head
# above still needs digits after that hyphen, so `2026--01`, `2026-` and `2026-x01` matched
# it not at all and fell to the flexible reader -- which invented January 2026, the whole of
# 2026, and *October 1st* respectively, none of which appears in the text. Claiming the
# opening separately is what makes the classifier total in the way it always claimed to be:
# a token that opens in ISO syntax is judged as ISO or refused, never handed on because the
# rest of it was too broken to parse. A bare `2026` carries no hyphen and is untouched.
_ISO_CALENDAR_OPENING = re.compile(r"^\d{4}-")

# --- Which language the *time* portion is written in ---
#

# or the whole point is `_MalformedIso`, with no path to the lenient reader. The time portion
# never got that treatment. It was fenced instead by one returned-value check plus a text
# check per defect discovered -- one for over-long fractions, one for wrong-width calendar
# runs -- and a dangling `.` was simply the next defect no existing check named. Growing that
# list is the shape this module has been refactored away from twice.
#
# So the same question is asked of the trailing text that is asked of the head: which
# language is it in? **Letters mean a human spelling** -- `10:00 AM`, `2pm`, `14:00:00 UTC`,
# `at 14:00`, `noon` -- which has no literal reading for a guess to contradict, so the
# lenient reader is trusted with it exactly as the two-language contract requires. **Digits
# and punctuation alone mean machine syntax**, and machine syntax is read literally or
# refused. `T` and `Z` are the two exceptions: they are ISO's own markers rather than words.
#
# That split is what a shape test on `[T ]digit` alone cannot do. `10:00 AM`, `2pm` and
# `14:00:00 UTC` all open that way and all must stay lenient; every malformed spelling that
# reached the reader carried no letters at all.

# --- Readings must not depend on when they are taken ---
#
# A qualifier's meaning has to be recoverable from the note's own bytes, because those are
# the only thing that travels. `@occurred:yesterday` failed that: dateparser resolved it
# against the wall clock of each parse, so reindexing an unedited note replaced its stored
# range with a different one -- `[2026-08-31,)` on September 1, `[2026-09-09,)` on the
# 10th -- and a search that matched last week stopped matching today with nothing having
# changed on disk.
#
# The two obvious repairs both reintroduce the drift by another route. Anchoring to the
# entity's `created_at` anchors to derived metadata that can shift on re-import or clone.
# Storing the resolved range makes the projection unreproducible: a fresh clone reindexing
# from markdown alone cannot arrive at it, and this table is rebuilt from markdown by
# definition. Refusing is what keeps the file the sole source of truth, and it is what the
# classifier already does with an ISO-shaped token it cannot pin down.
#
# The rule is *determinism*, not a vocabulary. A list of relative words is the shape this
# guard was refactored away from once already, and it could never have covered the whole
# of dateparser's relative vocabulary in every language it reads. Instead the reading is
# taken twice against two stated reference instants and kept only if it did not move.
# Whatever `now` was reaching -- a word, a phrase, an omitted component -- lands somewhere
# different under each, so it is caught without ever being named.
#
# The comparison is on the resulting *range*, never on dateparser's datetime. A month or a
# year is delimited by what the author wrote, and `_read_flexible_point` discards the
# components its `period` does not vouch for, so `June 2026` and `2026` answer with one
# range from two different datetimes. Comparing datetimes would refuse them.

# A digit run no calendar component could be, and the reason this module refuses to hand
# one to a reader at all. Python declines to convert a decimal string longer than
# `sys.get_int_max_str_digits()` -- 4300 by default, and never settable below 640 -- into an
# int, and dateparser converts the runs it finds without catching that. So a token carrying
# a long enough run raised `ValueError` straight out of the reader and aborted the parse of
# the *entire note*, taking every other observation on the page with it. That is worse than
# any wrong date: elsewhere an unreadable qualifier costs its own token and nothing else.
#
# The cap is far below the smallest limit the runtime allows and far above the widest run a
# point can legitimately carry -- six digits of a fractional second, four of a year -- so it
# separates "no date" from "real date" without ever being the rule that decides a readable
# token's fate.

    A year or a month is a period the author delimited by writing it. A date or a
    moment is not: `@effective 2026-06-10` means the decision took effect that day and
    still holds, so closing the range at midnight would expire it overnight. Callers
    that need a closed interval write the range literal instead.

    Non-ISO spellings are read leniently, because guessing at `June 10, 2026` is the
    whole point of this reader. A token that *is* ISO-shaped is held to its own text
    instead, in both halves. Its calendar components must name a real date. And a time of
    day after them is judged by the language it is written in: words are a human spelling
    the lenient reader is trusted with (`10:00 AM`, `2pm`, `noon`, `14:00:00 UTC`), while
    digits and punctuation alone are machine syntax, which must parse as a real ISO time or
    the whole point goes unread. So `2026-06-10 10:00 AM` reads and `2026-01-01T` does not;
    `2026-01-01T10:00:00.1234567` does not, because storing it would mean dropping the
    digits that made it worth writing; and `2026-01-01T10:00:00.` does not either, because
    a fractional separator with no fraction behind it names no moment at all.

    A reading that would depend on when it was taken is refused, however it is spelled:
    `yesterday`, `2 days ago`, `next month`, a bare `March` whose year would come from
    the current one. What the author wrote must name the same interval on every pass, or
    the note does not say when it holds -- see the section comment above for why anchoring
    it elsewhere would not fix that. Precision the author simply did not write is a
    different thing and still reads: `2026` and `June 2026` delimit their own periods.
