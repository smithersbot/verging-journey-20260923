"""Compute the readiness contract for one project (#1414).

Readiness answers a question a pending-count alone cannot: may a caller trust
what a read returns? The durable `project.last_indexed_at` marker separates
"never indexed" from "indexed and idle"; the three stages below then say what
is still owed, so a waiter blocks on the stage it depends on instead of on a
single aggregate that settles too early.

Every count here is derived state and is read without locking, per the
consistency model in CLAUDE.md: the numbers may lag a concurrent index pass by
one poll, which is exactly what a waiter is polling to observe.

        The invariant, which every count in this file has to satisfy: **anything
        reported as pending must be drainable by some pass.** A number no pass
        can reduce is not pending work -- it is a fact about the graph -- and a
        waiter that blocks on it waits forever. This predicate therefore has to
        ask the question the resolver asks, not a question that merely resembles
        it.

        Two kinds of unresolved link are excluded for that reason:

        - A link whose target does not exist. No pass creates the target, so
          counting it would leave every ordinary knowledge base permanently
          PENDING and make IDLE unreachable.
        - A link whose title matches more than one note.
          `BulkLinkResolver.resolve_strict` deliberately refuses an ambiguous
          title (`ambiguous_title = len(title_matches) > 1`, and the title branch
          only returns when exactly one matches), so no pass will ever wire it
          up either.

        What remains is the state the #1414 report hit: a link to a note that
        does exist and resolves unambiguously, written moments ago, whose
        resolution has not run yet.

        Permalinks are unique, so a permalink match is never ambiguous. The
        resolver's matching is broader than these two forms, so this stays a
        lower bound: a link only its fuzzy path would catch settles one pass
        later than reported, which errs toward IDLE rather than toward a wait

        Both sides are defined by what semantic retrieval actually does, because
        a definition that merely resembles retrieval drifts from it in both
        directions at once (#1414 review):

        - Owed is ``entity_embeddings_enabled``, the shared opt-out policy in
          ``search_service`` that ``sync_entity_vectors_batch`` uses to clear and
          skip a note. Counting an ``embed: false`` note as owed would leave the
          stage PENDING forever, since no pass will ever embed it.
        - Usable is ``CURRENT_VECTOR_MANIFEST_PREDICATE``, the literal predicate
          vector hydration applies. Counting a chunk left behind by an
          embedding-model or vector-index change as done would report IDLE while
          retrieval returns nothing for that note.

        Reported as a set difference rather than a subtraction of counts: an
        entity can hold a usable vector and no longer be owed one (its note took
        ``embed: false``), and only sets get that right without a clamp.

        One thing this deliberately does not verify is that a ready manifest row
        still has its physical vector. The only portable way to check is a
        search repository, and building one loads the embedding model — a cost a
        polled status route must not pay. ``bm project info`` verifies it, via
        ``ProjectService.get_embedding_status``, and recommends a rebuild.

        With semantic search off there is no embedding work to wait for, so the
        stage reports zero of zero and settles immediately rather than parking
        the whole project in PENDING forever.
