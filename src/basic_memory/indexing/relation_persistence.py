"""Publish a note's derived graph under one accepted content generation.

The publication carries the complete observation, temporal, section, and relation
projections through one note_content fence lifecycle and one durable retry marker.

The graph tables are eventually consistent projections, not part of the accepted write's
transaction. Publication runs after the content commit; a stale fence makes every statement
a no-op (the newer generation owns convergence); a crashed or failed publication is repaired
by a later index pass republishing the same generation. Readers must tolerate a note whose
projections briefly lag its accepted content. This is deliberate: pulling these writes back
into one shared transaction — or adding cross-table locks to close the lag — is what caused
the #1213/#1214 deadlock and duplication incidents.
