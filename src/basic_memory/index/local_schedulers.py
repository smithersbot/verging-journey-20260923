"""Background work scheduling for the local runtime.

Note mutations schedule derived work — semantic vector sync, search reindex,
project indexing, and forward-reference resolution — off the request path.
This module owns the in-process task machinery and the local scheduler
implementations; the FastAPI composition root in ``basic_memory.deps.services``
wires them into route dependencies. Cloud composes queue-backed equivalents
behind the same protocols.
