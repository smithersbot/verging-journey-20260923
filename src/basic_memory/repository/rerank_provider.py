"""Reranker provider protocol for pluggable cross-encoder rescoring.

A reranker rescores a small candidate set (query + document together via
cross-attention) after retrieval, recovering relevant results that bi-encoder /
FTS ranking left just below the top-k cutoff. Mirrors ``embedding_provider`` so
the same provider families and config shape apply to a different pipeline stage.
