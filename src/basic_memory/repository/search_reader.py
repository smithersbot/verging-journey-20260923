"""Scoped search retrieval shared by every route.

``SearchReader`` runs one prepared query over one ``ProjectScope``: the engine's
full-text statement for FTS mode, and vector or hybrid retrieval through
``SemanticSearch`` when the semantic stack is present. Neither class owns indexing,
manifest writes, or table lifecycle. A repository builds a reader per call from its
current state, so a repository whose semantic stack was disabled at startup hands the
reader the matching capability set; a route reading several projects at once builds
one directly over a wider scope.
