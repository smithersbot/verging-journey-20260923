"""Project-scoped rclone sync commands for Basic Memory Cloud.

This module provides simplified, project-scoped rclone operations:
- Each project syncs independently
- Routes through the project's tenant-scoped remote (SyncProject.remote_name);
  the default tenant keeps "basic-memory-cloud", others use their own (see #919)
- Balanced defaults from SPEC-8 Phase 4 testing
- Per-project bisync state tracking

Replaces tenant-wide sync with project-scoped workflows.
