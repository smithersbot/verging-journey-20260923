"""Client for the cloud WebDAV file surface.

`bm cloud upload` already speaks the write half of this protocol: a plain
``PUT /webdav/{project}/{path}`` carrying an ``X-OC-Mtime`` header. Team
`push`/`pull` need the read half as well (#1262) — ``PROPFIND`` to enumerate a
project and ``GET`` to fetch a file — together with the validators (entity tag,
last-modified) that let a transfer decide whether two sides actually differ.

This module sits beside ``upload.py`` rather than inside it. ``upload.py`` is the
implementation of one command: a directory walk that prints its own progress and
owns that command's filtering rules. What follows is protocol only — no CLI
output, no policy — so that the push/pull engine in ``webdav_transfer.py`` and
the upload command can share one definition of how a project's files are
addressed.

Access control is the reason this transport exists at all. Every request here is
authorized by the service against the caller's access to *this* project, whereas
object-storage credentials are scoped to an entire tenant bucket and cannot
express per-project access.
