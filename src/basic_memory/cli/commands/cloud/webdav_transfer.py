"""Directional transfers (`bm cloud push` / `bm cloud pull`) over WebDAV.

On Personal workspaces these transfers run through rclone against object
storage. That requires tenant-scoped storage credentials, which are scoped to a
whole bucket and therefore cannot express "this member may read project A but
not project B" — on a Team workspace they would grant more access than the
service itself does, and minting them is restricted to workspace owners anyway,
so members were simply stuck (#1262).

The WebDAV surface enforces access where it belongs: every request is authorized
against the caller's access to the specific project. This module is the same
transfer engine over that transport, and it keeps the same contract:

- additive — nothing is ever deleted on the destination
- files that differ on both sides are conflicts, resolved only by an explicit
  ``--on-conflict`` choice
- a path the plan cleared as new is only ever created, never used to replace
  something that arrived in the meantime — enforced at the write itself, by an
  exclusive create on pull and a conditional create on push
- deletions are not propagated (see #862)

Comparison is by entity tag plus size, falling back to last-modified plus size
when the service reports no entity tag we can treat as a content hash. See
``_compare`` for why that fallback errs toward reporting a conflict, and
``_drop_appeared_on_cloud`` for how a stale plan is kept from overwriting a note
nobody compared.
