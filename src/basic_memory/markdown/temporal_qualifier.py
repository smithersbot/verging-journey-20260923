"""Peel SPEC-82 temporal qualifiers off observation content.

An observation may carry one qualifier immediately after its category and before its
content. Three authored forms exist, and the kind is optional in all of them:

    - [decision] @effective[2026-06-10,2026-07-27) The cache layer will use Redis.
    - [decision] @effective:2026-07-27 The cache layer will use Memcached.
    - [decision] @effective:"June 10, 2026" The cache layer will use Memcached.
    - [decision] @2026-07-27 The cache layer will use Memcached.

The bracket form carries a range literal and needs no separator, because no kind name
can begin with `[` or `(`. The point forms need the `:` because a date can begin with a
letter (`June 10, 2026`), so nothing else would tell a kind-and-date from a handle.

**An unquoted point is one whitespace-delimited token.** dateparser reads far more than
one token -- `June 10, 2026` and `2026-06-10 10:00 AM` both resolve, and
`parse_authored_point` accepts them -- but nothing here can tell where such a date ends:
dateparser also reads `June 10, 2026 The` and `2026-06-10 The`, so growing the token
until parsing fails would swallow the author's prose.

**A quoted point is exactly what the author put between the quotes**, which is how a
multi-word or month-only date is written: `@occurred:"June 10, 2026"`, `@"June 2026"`.
Quoting settles where the token ends; it does not make a date mean something fixed, so
`@occurred:"2 days ago"` is delimited and still refused. The closing quote is the token
boundary, so whatever follows it is ordinary content, and a `\\"` inside the value does
not end the token. The scan mirrors `_split_predicate_items` in `mcp/tools/posix_tools.py`, down to
its rule that an unterminated quote is a typo to report rather than a boundary to guess
at -- scanning on to end of line would hand the author's prose to dateparser. Only the
double quote opens the form: an apostrophe is ordinary punctuation, and a scan looking
for its partner would turn `@note:'s` and its like into diagnostics.

Inside quotes the author delimited the value, so there is nothing to truncate and
dateparser's reading is taken as written. An *unquoted* token is refused in two shapes
that do parse, so a truncated read never becomes a plausible-looking assertion:

* **A short number.** dateparser reads `1` as January and `3.5` as March 5, but at the
  head of a line those are list markers and version numbers. A numeric point must be at
  least as wide as a year.
* **A word naming only a month or a year** (`June`, `may`, `v2`). Alone it is usually
  prose; as the first token of `June 10, 2026` reading it would file June 2026 and leave
  `10, 2026` in the content. No bare word is filed at all now: the only ones that named a
  specific day were relative (`yesterday`, `today`), and a qualifier whose meaning moves
  with the calendar is refused outright -- see `basic_memory.temporal` for why. A month
  name is still *recognized* here, not to file it but to tell an author who wrote
  `@occurred:June 10, 2026` that quoting is the fix.

Beyond those, one rule decides everything: **if the payload reads as time, the token
becomes a qualifier; if it does not, the token stays ordinary observation content,
silently.** Prose is full of `@` -- email addresses, handles, `@todo:` markers -- and
warning about each one that is not a date would be noise, not help.

Three things are reported instead, because each one names its own fix:

* an **unknown kind** (`@asserted:2026-06-10`) -- the payload parses as time and the
  author is plainly reaching for this feature, so a short list of valid kinds helps;
* an **unterminated quote** -- the author opened the quoted form and mistyped;
* an unquoted point refused by the guards above **whose line continues with a digit**
  (`@occurred:June 10, 2026 ...`) -- the one shape where the token rule silently costs
  the author a date they clearly wrote, and the quoted form is what they wanted.

A refused or unread qualifier is never peeled. Its text stays in the observation
content, so the line indexes exactly as it does today and remains full-text searchable;
only the derived temporal projection is withheld.
