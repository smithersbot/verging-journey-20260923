"""Structural section scanning for markdown note bodies.

A section is one heading-bounded span of a note body: the heading line through the
line before the next heading of the same or higher level (subsections stay inside
their parent, so spans nest). Sections are coordinates into canonical content —
body-relative line numbers and utf-8 byte offsets — never a copy of it (SPEC-47 /
issue #1403).

The scan is structural, not semantic: it runs on every markdown parse regardless of
the ``bm_parse_semantics`` opt-out, so graph-silent notes (e.g. PDF extraction text)
are still section-addressable.
