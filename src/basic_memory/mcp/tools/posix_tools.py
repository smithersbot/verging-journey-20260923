"""POSIX-style read-only tools for Basic Memory MCP server.

Six familiar Unix verbs — cat, grep, ls, find, tail, man — each a thin
translation over the same typed API clients the canonical tools use. They are
tagged ``POSIX_TOOLS_TAG`` and hidden until startup: the composition root in
``basic_memory.mcp.server`` sets their visibility from the default-enabled
``enable_posix_tools`` config flag at lifespan startup, so no tool body ever
checks config itself.

Projects are mount points (#1415): when no ``project``/``project_id`` param is
given, a path or identifier whose first segment names an addressable project
routes there, with the remainder as the project-relative path — inputs accept
exactly the '<project>/path' identifiers tool outputs produce. An explicit
project param plus an agreeing prefix strips the prefix; a disagreeing one
refuses naming both. Where more than one project is addressable — several local
projects, or a cloud workspace holding several — an unrecognized first segment
refuses with the project list rather than silently defaulting (#1421); the
mount view and the resolver read one list, so anything ``ls "/"`` advertises is
addressable by name. The resolver answers with both routing fields — the project
and its external_id — and every tool hands that pair to ``get_project_client``
verbatim, which is what keeps a cloud mount bound to the workspace whose listing
advertised it.

Collision rule: the project always wins over a same-named top-level folder in
the default project, so that folder is only reachable unqualified when a single
project is addressable (where there is no ambiguity); the qualified
'<project>/folder/...' form always reaches it. ``man`` is excluded — its
``project`` param names the manual project, not a data project.

# --- Round-trip coherence ---
# A path a routed verb returns must be a path the resolver accepts. When a call
# addresses its project in the path ('ls research/notes'), the project prefix is
# stripped before the project-scoped API sees it, so that API answers in
# project-relative paths — '/notes'. Handing those back unchanged breaks the
# navigation loop the mount model promises: feeding '/notes' into `ls` refuses as
# unqualified, or worse, opens a *different* project that happens to be mounted
# as 'notes'.
#
# One rule decides *whether* and *with what* (_route_prefix); each response
# schema says *where*. That split is deliberate. Rewriting by key name anywhere
# in the payload also rewrote a note's own frontmatter when the author happened
# to use a `file_path:` key, so a routed `cat` returned frontmatter that
# disagreed with both its own `content` and the stored file. Transport metadata
# and note content are different things that can spell a key the same way, and
# only position tells them apart.

        depth: How many levels to recurse (1-10, default: 10). A non-default
            depth cannot combine with `meta` (the subtree scope is
            all-or-nothing).
        page: Page number (1-indexed).
        page_size: Nodes per page.
        meta: Frontmatter metadata predicates, repeatable; every predicate must
            hold. One predicate per string, one predicate per key, at least one
            predicate (omit `meta` for the directory listing):
              "status=active"              equality
              "confidence>0.6"             comparison: > >= < <=
              "priority in high,critical"  any of the listed values
              "tags has security,oauth"    array contains ALL listed values
              "score between 0.3,0.8"      inclusive range
              "owner=null"                 key missing or explicitly null
            Values are JSON-scalar inferred ("true"/"false"/"null"/numbers
            become booleans/None/numbers); quote a token to force a literal
            string (e.g. 'status="true"'), including inside a list, where the
            quotes also protect a comma ('label in "a,b",c' matches "a,b" or
            "c") and a value that itself starts with an operator character
            ('range=">=5"'). Numbers must be finite, and null is only meaningful
            with "=" — the other operators compare against the value, and a
            comparison with null is never true. Keys accept dot-paths
            ("review.approved"); "note_type" aliases the frontmatter "type" key.
            String equality and "in" on either type spelling use normalized
            note-type matching ("LiteraryDevice" matches "literary_device").
            Other metadata keys and operators retain their usual comparisons.
            Any other operator fails fast naming the supported set.
        fields: Frontmatter fields to return per hit (dot-paths allowed), e.g.
            ["title", "priority"]. Requires `meta`. A field missing on a hit
            renders as null — rows are never dropped. Requesting fields also
            narrows each row to the note's identity plus those values: the
            projection replaces the note body rather than riding alongside it.
        project: Project name. Optional - qualified paths route themselves;
            unqualified paths refuse when several projects are addressable.
        project_id: Project external_id (UUID); takes precedence over `project`.
        context: Optional FastMCP context.

    Returns:
        Without `meta`: the directory listing as JSON (nodes, pagination,
        totals). With `meta`: the search response as JSON (results, pagination,
        totals). Adding `fields` projects each result down to the note's
        identity — title, permalink, file_path, external_id, updated_at — plus
        the requested `fields` object; no note content comes back.

    The path scope is ``route.path`` — the caller's input verbatim when no

    reads "./specs" the way the directory listing does, and collapses every root

    rather than a subtree — onto "no scope". It composes server-side as a

    lives, not its permalink, which stops mirroring that path once a note pins
