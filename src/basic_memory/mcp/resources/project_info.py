    This resource provides detailed statistics and status information about a
    Basic Memory project, including:

    - Project configuration
    - Entity, observation, and relation counts
    - Graph metrics (most connected entities, isolated entities)
    - Recent activity and growth over time
    - System status (database, watch service, version)

    Args:
        workspace: Workspace permalink from the resource URI. Use ``local`` for
            a configured local project.
        project: Project permalink from the resource URI.
        context: Optional FastMCP context for performance caching.

    Returns:
        Detailed project information and statistics as a JSON document —
        resources carry text, so the validated response is serialized here.
