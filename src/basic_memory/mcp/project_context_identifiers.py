    This is the *only* way to turn a path-shaped input into a project plus a

    argument: a project name may contain '/', and ``generate_permalink``
    preserves it, so how many leading segments a project consumes is a fact
    about the known projects, never about the string. Callers that split on
    the first '/' instead kept rediscovering that — for mounts (#1421), then
    again for workspace routes.

    The longest permalink wins, which is also the only reading that can be
    right when one project's permalink prefixes another's ('research' beside
    'research/2026'). Returns None when no permalink claims the leading
    segments; the remainder has no leading slash and is "" at the root.

    A claim that would leave no remainder must spell the permalink exactly,
    extension included. Dropping an extension only when a match would swallow
    the whole path stops a same-named note ('moby-dick.txt' in project
    'moby-dick') from being misread as the project itself with nothing after
    it. Callers that also know project display names may recover an exact-name
    project-root match before calling this permalink-only parser; a remainder
    still permits extension stripping because the leading segments
