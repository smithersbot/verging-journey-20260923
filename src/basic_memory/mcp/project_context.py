    Detection, not resolution. A leading segment that names no project is the

    and a search query is arbitrary text — so the answer for it is None and the
    caller's active/default project applies. That is why these tools do not
    adopt the posix verbs' refusal rule (#1421): there a first segment naming
    nothing is an error, here it is the common input.

    What they do adopt is the *set*, and its precedence. A path-shaped
    identifier names a project only when a project set the session already holds
    claims its leading segments, and every set is claimed by the same
    ``split_project_permalink_prefix``, so how many segments a project spans
    stays a fact about the known projects rather than a guess about the string:

    1. the local config (``detect_project_from_url_prefix``), free to read;
    2. ``addressable_projects`` — the session's own mount table, the same set
       ``ls /`` advertises and ``resolve_project_path_route`` routes by. In a
       hosted session that listing comes from the session's own tenant route, so
       it is exactly the projects of the workspace this session is bound to;
    3. then, and only then, an explicitly workspace-qualified
       '<workspace>/<project>/<path>' route, for projects in workspaces this
       session's own route does not list.

    Mounts before workspace routes is ``resolve_project_path_route``'s order,
    for its reason: only one reading of '<name>/...' can win, and a name ``ls
    /`` advertises must address that mount or we advertise an address that
    resolves somewhere else. Reading it the other way here meant `ls team/docs`
    and `read_note("team/docs/x")` disagreed about what 'team' named. It is also
    the cheaper order — a mount hit never builds the account-wide workspace
    index at all.

    Nothing is resolved by *searching* for a name. The deleted fallback did: it
    split one leading segment off and handed it to the account-wide workspace
    index, which answered with a project in whichever accessible workspace held
    that permalink — preferring the ``is_default`` workspace when several did.
    An ordinary project-relative path therefore read another workspace's
    same-named project, silently (#1432), and a project whose permalink spans
    two segments ('Research/2026') was unreachable, because one segment was all
    the split ever offered.

# --- Project-qualified path routing (POSIX tools, #1415) ---
# Projects are mount points: '<project>/path' inputs route to that project so
# tool inputs accept exactly the prefixed identifiers tool outputs and stored
# permalinks produce. One resolver serves the MCP posix tools and, through
# them, the CLI verbs.
#
# The mount table and the routing table are one set (addressable_projects), so
# every mount `ls /` advertises is reachable by name and an unqualified
# reference in a many-project workspace refuses instead of picking a default
# (#1421).
#
# Precedence: the mount table wins the leading path segments, ahead of
# workspace-qualified '<workspace>/<project>/<path>' parsing. A project permalink
# can also be an accessible workspace's slug, and only one reading of '<name>/...'
# can win. Mount-wins is what the advertised list promises — a name `ls /` shows
# must address that mount, or we advertise a name that resolves somewhere else,
# which is worse than not advertising it at all. "Segments", plural: a project
# name may contain '/', so its advertised permalink can span more than one.
#
# Route versus path is inherently ambiguous, so the answer is a precedence
# order, not a parser. 'acme/docs/foo' is a well-formed workspace route AND a
# well-formed folder path inside the caller's own project; no analysis of the
# string, and no amount of knowing which projects exist, recovers which the
# caller meant. One question settles it: does the call already say which project
# it means?
#
#   1. An explicit project (param or env constraint) says so. The remaining path
#      is inside that project and nothing reroutes it. A prefix naming a
#      *different* addressable mount still conflicts rather than being silently
#      preferred — that is a contradiction in one call, not an ambiguity.
#   2. Otherwise the leading segments are read as a route, but only when they
#      name an accessible workspace AND a project inside it. A path that merely
#      looks workspace-shaped ('notes/2026/foo') matches nothing and stays
#      relative on its own.
#
# Rule 2 deliberately does not depend on how many projects the session mounts.
# It did briefly, to keep a coincidentally workspace-shaped relative path at
# home in a one-mount session; that made the qualified paths this layer *itself*
# emits unroutable there, since replaying one without the project argument read
# the sole mount's same-named path instead. Both readings are a silent
# wrong-project read, so the tie breaks on whose string it is: the emitted
# canonical form is ours and must route back, while a user-typed path that
# collides with a real workspace and project has an explicit, documented fix in
# rule 1. Coincidence loses to the address we published.
#
# Rule 3 (mounts) sits above all of this: a name `ls /` advertises always
# addresses that mount.
#
# The cost of that choice, stated plainly: when a project's permalink equals an
# accessible workspace's slug, that workspace's OTHER projects lose their
# qualified path spelling. With '/team' advertised as a mount, 'team/docs/x' is
# project 'team', path 'docs/x' — never workspace 'team', project 'docs'. Those
# projects stay addressable through the project param (project='team/docs' with
# the project-relative path 'x'), which is the escape hatch the prefix-conflict
# message already teaches, so nothing becomes unreachable — only differently
# spelled.
