"""The readiness contract a caller waits on before trusting a project's reads.

The bug this exists to kill (#1414): ``bm status`` reported a project ready
because it had no pending work, when in fact no work had ever been queued. A
count of outstanding items cannot tell "nothing to do" from "nothing was ever
started", so a waiter polling that count returns a plausible zero instead of an
error. The phase below carries that distinction as data, and every stage carries
its own copy so a caller can wait on the stage it actually depends on.

    Three members, not four. A distinct ``indexing`` and a ``failed`` are not

    an index pass runs inside whichever process owns the scheduler, so a
    separate ``bm status`` process cannot see one in flight, and the local
    runtime wires no fanout-failure recorder (``LocalProjectIndexRuntime``
    leaves it ``None``), so a failed pass leaves no durable trace to read.
    ``PENDING`` therefore covers both "a pass is running right now" and "a pass
