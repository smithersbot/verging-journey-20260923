"""Response schemas for knowledge graph operations.

This module defines the response formats for all knowledge graph operations.
Each response includes complete information about the affected entities,
including IDs that can be used in subsequent operations.

Key Features:
1. Every created/updated object gets an ID
2. Relations are included with their parent entities
3. Responses include everything needed for next operations
4. Bulk operations return all affected items
