"""Schema diff for Basic Memory.

Compares a schema definition against actual note usage to detect drift.
Drift happens naturally as notes evolve -- new observation categories appear,
old ones fall out of use, single-value fields become multi-value.

The diff engine reuses inference analysis internally, comparing inferred
frequencies against the declared schema fields to surface:
  - New fields: common in notes but not declared in schema
  - Dropped fields: declared in schema but rare in actual notes
  - Cardinality changes: field changed from single to array or vice versa
