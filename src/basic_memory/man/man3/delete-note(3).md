# delete-note(3)

## NAME

**delete-note** — delete a note or directory from the knowledge base

## SYNOPSIS

MCP:

```
delete_note(identifier, is_directory=False, project=None, project_id=None,
            output_format="text")
```

CLI:

```
bm tool delete-note IDENTIFIER [--is-directory] [--project NAME]
```

## PARAMETERS

- **identifier** (string, required) — For files: note title or permalink to delete. For directories: the directory path (e.g., "docs", "projects/2025"). Can be a title like "Meeting Notes" or permalink like "notes/meeting-notes"
- **is_directory** (boolean, optional, default: False) — If True, deletes an entire directory and all its contents. When True, identifier should be a directory path (without file extensions). Defaults to False.
- **project** (string | null, optional, default: None) — Project name to delete from. Optional - server will resolve using hierarchy. If unknown, use list_memory_projects() to discover available projects.
- **project_id** (string | null, optional, default: None) — Project external_id (UUID). Prefer this over `project` when known — it routes to the exact project regardless of name collisions across cloud workspaces. Takes precedence over `project`. Get from list_memory_projects().
- **output_format** (string, optional, default: "text") — "text" preserves existing behavior (bool/string). "json" returns machine-readable deletion metadata.

## DESCRIPTION

Removes a note (or, with `is_directory=True`, an entire directory and its
contents) from both the filesystem and the index. The file is gone — for
local projects an external backup or git history is the only undo; cloud
projects can fall back to snapshots (see bm-cloud(1) snapshots).

For directories the identifier is the directory path without file
extension (`"docs"`, `"projects/2025"`).

## MCP USAGE

Verified against playground/ (create-then-delete):

```
delete_note("playground/demo-doomed-note", project="manual",
            output_format="json")
# → {"deleted": true, "title": "Demo - Doomed Note",
#    "permalink": "manual/playground/demo-doomed-note"}
```

## GOTCHAS

- [gotcha] is_directory=True deletes recursively with no confirmation step — list_directory first and check what you are about to remove #safety
- [gotcha] Identifier accepts title or permalink; with same-titled notes in different folders, prefer the permalink #identifiers
- [gotcha] Relations pointing at a deleted note are kept as unresolved rows (the target id is cleared, the link text stays) and relink on their own when a note with that name is written again, so deletion is recoverable for the graph — but the note's own outgoing relations and observations are gone with the file #graph
- [pattern] For notes that might be referenced elsewhere, prefer moving to an archive/ folder over deletion — move-note keeps every relation resolved instead of leaving them unresolved until a recreate #workflow
