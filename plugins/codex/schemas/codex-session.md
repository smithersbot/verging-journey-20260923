# Codex Session

A **CodexSession** note is a resumable general checkpoint. It captures the
thread cursor: what changed, what was verified, what decisions matter, and what
the next Codex thread should do first.

Codex sessions are found by structured recall:
`search_notes(metadata_filters={"type": "codex_session"}, after_date="7d")`.

New checkpoints from one Codex chat share `agent: codex` and `session_id`.
Legacy `codex_session_id` remains accepted for existing notes. Each new
immutable checkpoint can use `continues [[Previous checkpoint title]]` to form a
navigable lineage without rewriting its predecessor.

## What Goes In A CodexSession

- **summary** - what happened.
- **changed_file** - changed or inspected paths that matter to resume.
- **verification** - commands actually run and their outcome.
- **decision** - choices made or surfaced.
- **blocker** - open failures, constraints, or rejected approaches.
- **next_step** - the next concrete action.

Validation is `warn` so checkpointing never blocks the user's flow.
