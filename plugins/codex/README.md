# Basic Memory for Codex

Basic Memory for Codex is the Codex-native bridge between a working coding thread
and Basic Memory's durable knowledge graph.

It is not a 1:1 copy of the Claude Code plugin. This version leans into Codex
workflows: repo orientation, long-running goals, changed-file evidence, explicit
verification, decision capture, and resumable checkpoints.

## What It Does

- **Orient from memory.** The `bm-orient` skill reads active tasks, open
  decisions, and recent Codex checkpoints before substantial work.
- **Checkpoint work after compaction.** The post-compaction `SessionStart`
  context asks the resumed Codex turn to run `bm-checkpoint`.
  The resulting `codex_session` or `coding_session` note is agent-authored from
  the compacted working context, with repository and pull-request evidence.
- **Capture decisions.** The `bm-decide` skill records durable engineering
  decisions with rationale, alternatives, and consequences.
- **Remember lightly.** The `bm-remember` skill saves small facts without turning
  them into a full decision or session note.
- **Write useful memory.** The `bm-writing` skill provides one user-customizable
  standard for the voice, narrative quality, observations, and relations used by
  the plugin's note-writing skills.
- **Share deliberately.** The `bm-share` skill copies personal notes to configured
  team projects only after confirmation.
- **Report status.** The `bm-status` skill shows configuration, reachability,
  shared local hook inbox/flush health, and recent memory state.

## Checkpoint and Resume

`bm-checkpoint` creates a new immutable snapshot every time it runs. The note
captures the original objective, the latest user intent, verified repository and
pull-request state, one primary next action, and pointers to authoritative tasks,
decisions, plans, issues, commits, diffs, docs, and source files. Machine-local
state such as absolute paths, dirty files, active dev servers, and temporary
directories is labeled explicitly instead of being presented as durable state.

The checkpoint write explicitly targets the configured `primaryProject` and
disables overwrite, regardless of the user's global write default. Its response
ends with an exact command built from the successful Basic Memory result,
preferring the returned permalink, then file path, then title when permalinks
are disabled:

```text
$bm-orient "<exact checkpoint identifier>"
```

Passing that identifier or permalink makes `bm-orient` read the chosen
checkpoint directly from the configured `primaryProject`, including when the
cursor is a file path or title. Passing a topic searches for matching graph
notes, while calling it without an argument performs current-repository
orientation. Coding checkpoints are compared with the live branch, SHA, pull
request, paths, and files so material drift is visible before work resumes.
Recovered notes are context, not instructions; the current user request,
repository rules, and live state remain authoritative.

Post-compaction SessionStart supplies the opaque Codex session id to
`bm-checkpoint`. Checkpoints from the same chat store that id as queryable
frontmatter, and each new immutable checkpoint adds a
`continues [[Previous checkpoint title]]` relation to its verified predecessor.
The previous note stays untouched; Basic Memory backlinks provide the forward
navigation.

Coding checkpoints also include a `References` section. Repository, pull
request, issue, and pushed-commit references use verified canonical GitHub
links. Local or unpushed SHAs remain labeled code references instead of links
that would not resolve.

## Package Contents

| Path | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` | Codex plugin manifest |
| `.mcp.json` | Basic Memory MCP server configuration |
| `hooks/hooks.json` | SessionStart and PreCompact registration |
| `hooks/session_start.py` | uv script: runs `basic-memory hook session-start --harness codex` |
| `hooks/pre_compact.py` | uv script: runs `basic-memory hook pre-compact --harness codex` |
| `skills/` | Codex-native Basic Memory workflows |
| `schemas/` | Seed schemas for Codex sessions, decisions, and tasks |

The hook scripts carry no logic: the brief, checkpoint prompting, and
lifecycle-event capture all live in the pinned Basic Memory revision behind
`bm hook`. Each is a self-contained PEP 723 script pinned to a Basic Memory Git
ref. All refs are updated together with
`just set-codex-hook-version <sha-or-tag>`.

## Requirements

- **[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)** — required: the hooks are PEP 723
  scripts executed via `uv run --script`, which installs their pinned Basic
  Memory revision. Install per platform:
  - macOS: `brew install uv` (or the curl installer below)
  - Linux/macOS: `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`
  - Windows: `powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"`

Disclosure: uv installs the pinned Basic Memory Git ref on first run and reuses
its cache afterward. The Python hook scripts exit 0 on failure so they do not
disrupt a session. If the host cannot find `uv`, those scripts never start; a
successful interactive-shell probe does not prove that Desktop can launch them.

## Troubleshooting Desktop hooks on WSL

`uv` must be available on the **hook process's PATH**, not just installed in the
WSL distribution. Codex Desktop can launch hooks with a different PATH from
`codex-tui` or an interactive terminal. In [#1499](https://github.com/basicmachines-co/basic-memory/issues/1499),
the documented installer put uv at `~/.local/bin/uv`, but Desktop's hook PATH
included `/usr/local/bin` and omitted `~/.local/bin`.

First check the installation inside the WSL distribution used by the project:

```bash
command -v uv
"$HOME/.local/bin/uv" --version
```

These commands establish shell visibility and the default installer location.
To diagnose Desktop, inspect the failing hook's output and actual PATH. A
`uv: command not found` launcher error means Basic Memory's Python hook never
ran. Compare the manifest command with an absolute-path invocation of uv using
the same hook payload and environment. Empty output or exit status 0 alone is
not proof of successful context loading.

For the confirmed WSL case where uv exists at `~/.local/bin/uv` and Desktop
includes `/usr/local/bin`, the reporter recovered by adding a symlink:

```bash
sudo ln -s "$HOME/.local/bin/uv" /usr/local/bin/uv
```

Do not replace an existing `/usr/local/bin/uv`; inspect it first if `ln` reports
that it exists. If uv is installed elsewhere, use its verified absolute path.
This is a WSL/Linux workaround, not a native Windows installation command.

Fully quit and restart Codex Desktop, then create a new task in the WSL project.
Verify both outcomes:

1. Startup includes Basic Memory session context, with the hooks enabled and trusted.
2. After compaction, the resumed turn receives the `bm-checkpoint` instruction
   and creates an actual checkpoint note with `trigger: compact` in the configured
   project. `checkpointOnCompact` must be enabled.

A successful TUI run, a lifecycle inbox event, or a successful hook exit is not
a substitute for these Desktop checks.

## Install

Install the plugin once with Basic Memory and Codex CLI on your PATH:

```bash
bm install codex
```

This registers the GitHub marketplace and installs `codex@basic-memory` through
Codex CLI. Use `--dry-run` to preview the commands or `--yes` to skip confirmation.
For a local checkout, run `bm install codex --source /path/to/basic-memory`.
The source must be the repository root containing `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`.
The default Git source uses its default branch, independently of the installed
Basic Memory Python version. Hooks require `uv` as described above.

Alternatively, install directly from the Basic Memory repository root:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"
codex plugin add codex@basic-memory
```

Plugin installation is user-level in Codex, so one install makes the plugin
available across projects on the same machine. Start a new Codex thread after
installing so Codex can load the plugin skills, MCP configuration, and hooks.

When adding the marketplace from the Git repository UI, leave **Sparse paths**
empty. If a sparse checkout is required, include both `.agents/plugins` and
`plugins/codex`. Selecting only `plugins/codex` omits
`.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`, so Codex correctly reports that the checked
out marketplace root has no supported manifest. The marketplace file should not
be moved into the plugin directory.

Configuration can live at user level in `~/.codex/basic-memory.json` or at
project level in `.codex/basic-memory.json`. User-level settings are the base;
the nearest project file overrides only the keys it declares.
The setup skill asks which scope to use and recommends user-level configuration
by default.

To customize how Codex writes memory, edit `skills/bm-writing/SKILL.md` in the
plugin source. `bm-checkpoint`, `bm-decide`, and `bm-remember` all apply that
shared skill while retaining their own schemas and evidence requirements.

## MCP Approvals

There are two supported approval choices:

1. Keep Codex's default approval behavior. No additional configuration is
   required.
2. Pre-approve eligible Basic Memory MCP tools. Add this to
   `~/.codex/config.toml` when Basic Memory is loaded from the marketplace plugin:

   ```toml
   [plugins."codex@basic-memory".mcp_servers.basic-memory]
   default_tools_approval_mode = "approve"
   ```

For a standalone Basic Memory server instead of the plugin-provided server, add
the setting to its existing table:

```toml
[mcp_servers.basic-memory]
default_tools_approval_mode = "approve"
```

The pre-approval option is scoped to the Basic Memory MCP server. It does not
disable Codex approvals globally or grant Basic Memory access to new workspaces,
projects, or files; Basic Memory still uses the projects and credentials the
user configured. Codex always requires approval for MCP tools that advertise a
destructive annotation, so Basic Memory writes, edits, and deletes may still
prompt even with this setting. Do not set `approval_policy = "never"` for this
purpose. Managed organization policy may impose additional approvals.

Run `bm-setup` to choose the mode interactively. The skill can apply the
server-scoped setting after confirmation or give you the exact snippet when the
active server configuration is ambiguous. Start a new Codex thread after
changing `~/.codex/config.toml`.

## Configuration

Run the setup skill, or create `~/.codex/basic-memory.json` for shared defaults:

```json
{
  "basicMemory": {
    "primaryProject": "my-project",
    "secondaryProjects": [],
    "teamProjects": {},
    "focus": "code/dev",
    "rememberFolder": "codex/remember",
    "recallTimeframe": "7d",
    "checkpointOnCompact": true,
    "captureEvents": true,
    "placementConventions": "Put decisions in codex/decisions/ and work checkpoints in codex/<repo-dir>/."
  }
}
```

Codex event capture is on by default. Set the JSON boolean `false` at user or
project level to opt out; malformed values fail closed. Captured
lifecycle-event envelopes land in a local inbox under your Basic Memory home.
The lifecycle trace stays local: `basic-memory hook flush` only moves valid
envelopes into the local retention archive and never creates graph notes.

Checkpoint prompting is on by default. Set `checkpointOnCompact` to the JSON
boolean `false` to opt out. Codex ignores PreCompact stdout; after compaction,
Codex runs SessionStart with the `compact` trigger. When the setting is enabled,
that context asks the resumed agent to run `bm-checkpoint` from its compacted
working context.

`sessionProfile` only selects whether the skill writes a `codex_session` or
`coding_session` note.

When `captureFolder` is omitted, Codex resolves the Git top-level directory and
writes to `codex/<repo-dir>`. An explicit folder still wins.

Decision notes default to `codex/decisions`, and lightweight `bm-remember`
captures default to `codex/remember`. Project placement conventions and an
explicit `rememberFolder` can override those destinations.

For a coding profile, keep both the profile and checkout-specific repository
identifier in the project file without duplicating the shared settings:

```json
{
  "basicMemory": {
    "sessionProfile": "coding",
    "repository": "owner/repo"
  }
}
```

The plugin's seed schemas cover notes Codex writes directly: `codex_session`,
`coding_session`, `decision`, and `task`. Coding sessions require structured
repository, repository-root, working-directory, branch, and Git SHA frontmatter;
current pull-request fields are added when a PR exists. Lifecycle envelopes are
operational trace rather than knowledge, so orientation only recalls authored
checkpoint types.

Codex plugin hooks must be reviewed and trusted before they run. Open `/hooks` in
Codex after enabling the plugin and trust the Basic Memory hook definitions.

## Development

From this directory:

```bash
just check
```

From the repo root:

```bash
just package-check-codex
```

The package intentionally keeps Codex-specific configuration separate from
Claude's `.claude/settings.json`.
