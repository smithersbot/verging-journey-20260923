# Basic Memory For Codex Status

Gather a concise diagnostic. Do not over-investigate.

## Gather

1. CLI reachability:
   - `basic-memory --version`
   - fallback `bm --version`
   - fallback `uvx --prerelease=allow basic-memory --version`

   Keep going if no launcher resolves. The plugin hook scripts can still use
   their uv-managed environment; report hook health as unavailable instead of
   claiming the hooks cannot work.

2. Plugin config:
   - read `~/.codex/basic-memory.json`, then the nearest project
     `.codex/basic-memory.json`; project keys override user keys
   - report the resolved `primaryProject`, `secondaryProjects`, `teamProjects`,
     `captureFolder`, `rememberFolder`, `recallTimeframe`, `focus`,
     `sessionProfile`, `repository`, `checkpointOnCompact`, and `captureEvents`
   - resolve omitted Codex defaults as `rememberFolder=codex/remember`,
     and `checkpointOnCompact=true`

3. Core hook health:
   - with the first available launcher, run
     `basic-memory hook status --harness codex --project-dir <repo-root>`
   - report the shared inbox path, pending envelopes, archived envelopes, last
     flush, settings state, resolved primary project, capture state, capture
     folder, checkpoint-prompt state, Basic Memory version, and uv version from
     that command
   - inbox counts are global across supported harnesses; do not attribute a
     backlog solely to Codex
   - treat the command's settings resolution as canonical for hook behavior; if
     it disagrees with the manually read config, show the mismatch

4. Hook files and launcher visibility:
   - check `uv --version` in the current environment independently of CLI
     reachability; uv is a required hook prerequisite
   - distinguish "uv missing from this shell" from "Desktop hook runtime
     verified"; shell success does not establish the Desktop hook process's PATH
   - when Desktop/WSL hooks fail while TUI works, inspect the actual hook
     launch error and PATH; `uv: command not found` occurs before the Python
     script can emit a diagnostic
   - consult `../../README.md` under "Troubleshooting Desktop hooks on WSL"
     for the default-location probe and conditional symlink workaround
   - only report Desktop hook execution as verified when startup context and a
     post-compaction checkpoint note were observed; otherwise label it unverified
   - confirm `plugins/codex/hooks/hooks.json` exists if running from this repo
   - remind the user that Codex plugin hooks must be reviewed and trusted before
     they run

5. Basic Memory queries:
   - query recent `type=codex_session`; when
     `sessionProfile=coding`, also query `type=coding_session` with
     `repository=<configured repository>`, then merge, deduplicate, sort newest
     first, and keep the newest five; never run an unscoped coding-session query
     when the repository is missing; these are agent-authored checkpoints, while
     lifecycle envelopes remain local operational trace
   - active `type=task`, `status=active`
   - open `type=decision`, `status=open`

## Present

Use this shape:

```text
Basic Memory for Codex
- CLI: <version or missing>
- Project: <primaryProject or default>
- Reads from: <secondaryProjects or none>
- Share targets: <teamProjects or none>
- Capture folder: <captureFolder>
- Remember folder: <rememberFolder>
- Recall timeframe: <recallTimeframe>
- Session profile: <general | coding>
- Repository: <owner/name or none>
- Checkpoint on compact: <enabled | disabled>
- Event capture: <enabled | disabled>
- Shared hook inbox: <path or unavailable>
- Shared pending envelopes: <count or unavailable>
- Shared archived envelopes: <count or unavailable>
- Last flush: <timestamp, never, or unavailable>
- Hook runtime in this environment: basic-memory <version>; uv <version or missing>
- Desktop hook execution: <verified from context and checkpoint | unverified>
- Recent checkpoints: <count across coding_session and codex_session>
- Active tasks: <count>
- Open decisions: <count>
- Hooks: installed; trust review required in Codex
```

List recent checkpoints by type, title, and permalink when available. Warn when
event capture is enabled and pending envelopes are accumulating or the last flush
is `never`, while noting that another harness may contribute to the shared counts.
Do not warn about an empty inbox when capture is disabled.
