# Basic Memory for Claude Code

The bridge between **Claude's working memory** and **[Basic Memory](https://basicmemory.com)'s durable knowledge graph**.

Claude Code now keeps its own auto-memory — fast, in-context notes Claude writes
to itself. Basic Memory is the other half: a searchable, portable, semantic graph
of markdown files you and Claude both own. This plugin connects the two so you get
the [documented "use both" setup](https://docs.basicmemory.com/concepts/vs-built-in-memory)
automatically: Claude starts each session briefed from the graph, and checkpoints
the session back to it before the context window compacts.

> This package lives in the canonical [`basic-memory`](https://github.com/basicmachines-co/basic-memory)
> repository under `plugins/claude-code/` and only works with Claude Code. For
> framework-agnostic skills that work in any MCP agent, see the top-level
> [`skills/`](../../skills) directory.

## What it does

- **Session briefing (SessionStart hook).** When a session begins, the plugin
  queries Basic Memory for your active tasks and recent work and puts a short
  brief in front of Claude — so you start where you left off instead of cold.
- **Compaction checkpoint (PreCompact hook).** Right before Claude Code compacts
  the context window, the plugin writes a general `session` or schema-backed
  `coding_session` checkpoint note to the graph, so the texture of the session
  survives and the next one can resume from it.
- **Deliberate checkpoints (`bm-checkpoint` skill).** On request — "checkpoint
  this", "wrap up", "hand off" — Claude writes a durable handoff note: the story,
  verification actually run, decisions, blockers, and the next action. In a
  coding setup these are schema-backed `coding_session` notes with required
  repository, branch, and SHA context, plus typed pull-request context when a PR
  exists, queryable by structured filters instead of prose search.
- **Orient from memory (`bm-orient` skill).** A deliberate mid-session "where do
  things stand" — reads active tasks, open decisions, and recent checkpoints
  (repository-scoped for coding setups) and presents an evidence-backed
  orientation with permalinks.
- **Capture decisions (`bm-decide` skill).** Records a durable choice with
  rationale, alternatives, consequences, and affected work — the deliberate
  version of the output style's inline decision capture, available whether or
  not that style is enabled.
- **Capture reflexes (output style).** An opt-in output style teaches Claude to
  search the graph before answering recall questions, capture real decisions as
  typed `decision` notes, and cite permalinks.
- **Writing standard (`bm-writing` skill).** One user-customizable standard for
  how Claude writes memory — voice, narrative quality, observations, relations,
  and git anchors (project, branch, PR, sha) — applied by `bm-remember` and the
  capture reflexes.
- **Seed schemas.** Picoschema definitions for `session`, `decision`, and `task`
  notes, plus `coding_session` for coding setups, so the stuff the plugin writes
  is structured and findable by `search_notes` metadata filters — recall is
  precise, not fuzzy.

The full design and rationale live in [DESIGN.md](./DESIGN.md).

## Commands

Plugin skills are namespaced under the plugin name:

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `/basic-memory:bm-setup` | One-time guided setup — maps the project to a Basic Memory project, seeds the note schemas, installs the shared `memory-*` skills, optionally learns your conventions, and turns on the capture reflexes. Run this first. |
| `/basic-memory:bm-orient` | Deliberate orientation — reads active tasks, open decisions, and recent checkpoints from the graph and summarizes where things stand, with permalinks. The mid-session counterpart to the SessionStart brief. |
| `/basic-memory:bm-checkpoint` | Deliberate checkpoint — writes a durable handoff note (story, verification, decisions, next action). Coding setups get schema-backed `coding_session` notes with required Git identity. Also fires when you say "checkpoint this" or "wrap up". |
| `/basic-memory:bm-decide` | Capture a durable decision — rationale, alternatives, consequences, affected work — as a `type: decision` note findable by structured recall. Also fires when you say "record this decision". |
| `/basic-memory:bm-remember <text>` | Quick capture — saves the text to the `bm-remember` folder with a `manual-capture` tag. Also fires when you say "remember that…". |
| `/basic-memory:bm-share <note>` | Promote a personal note to a configured team project, with attribution and confirmation. The deliberate way to write to a shared workspace. |
| `/basic-memory:bm-status` | Diagnostic — shows the active project, team read-sources and share targets, capture folders, shared local hook inbox/flush health, recent session checkpoints, and active-task count. |
| `/basic-memory:bm-writing` | The writing standard applied whenever Claude writes or substantially revises a note. Not usually invoked directly — edit `skills/bm-writing/SKILL.md` to change how memory is written. |

## Requirements

- **[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)** — required: the hooks are PEP 723
  scripts executed via `uv run --script`. Install per platform:
  - macOS: `brew install uv` (or the curl installer below)
  - Linux/macOS: `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`
  - Windows: `powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"`
- [Basic Memory](https://github.com/basicmachines-co/basic-memory) connected as an
  MCP server. The hooks resolve their own `basic-memory` through uv, so no
  PATH install is required for them.
- Claude Code.

### What the hooks execute

The hook scripts are zero-logic PEP 723 uv scripts: `uv run --quiet --script`
resolves `basic-memory>=<floor>` (pinned in each script's inline metadata) and
the script invokes `basic-memory hook <event>` in-process with the hook JSON
on stdin. All behavior lives in the released Python package — versioned,
typed, and tested. Setting `BM_BIN` (a binary path or a quoted launcher
string) overrides the uv-managed environment, e.g. for development against a
local checkout. Two disclosures:

- **Network fetch on first run.** uv downloads `basic-memory` from PyPI at a
  pinned minimum version (bumped by release tooling); later runs use uv's
  cache.
- **Event capture is on by default.** Setting `captureEvents: false` disables
  lifecycle-event envelopes. Other values fail closed. Envelopes contain bounded
  lifecycle metadata and live in a local inbox under your Basic Memory home.
  Inspect with `basic-memory hook status`, archive locally with
  `basic-memory hook flush`. The lifecycle trace never becomes a graph note.

Every failure path exits 0 — the hooks stay invisible rather than disrupt a
session.

## Installation

Install the plugin once with Basic Memory and Claude Code on your PATH:

```bash
bm install claude-code
```

This registers the GitHub marketplace and installs `basic-memory@basicmachines-co`
through Claude Code, sparse-checking out only the two paths the plugin needs.
Use `--dry-run` to preview the commands or `--yes` to skip confirmation. The
default Git source uses its default branch, independently of the installed
Basic Memory Python version. Hooks require `uv` as described above.

The install is user-level, so one install covers every project on the machine.
Pass `--scope project` to declare the marketplace and plugin in the repository's
`.claude/settings.json` instead — the way to hand the plugin to a whole team —
or `--scope local` to keep it in untracked local settings. For a local checkout,
run `bm install claude-code --source /path/to/basic-memory`; the source must be
the repository root containing `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, and `--sparse`
is omitted because Claude Code accepts it only for Git sources.

Restart Claude Code after installing so it loads the plugin's skills, MCP
configuration, and hooks.

Alternatively, run the underlying commands directly:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add basicmachines-co/basic-memory --sparse .claude-plugin plugins/claude-code
claude plugin install basic-memory@basicmachines-co
```

## Configuration

The fastest path is **`/basic-memory:bm-setup`** — a ~2-minute interview that writes
the config, seeds the schemas, and turns on the capture reflexes. The SessionStart
hook nudges you toward it on first run.

To configure by hand instead: the hooks work out of the box against your **default**
Basic Memory project — no config required. To pin a specific project (recommended,
and required for the PreCompact checkpoint to write), add a `basicMemory` block to
your project's `.claude/settings.json`. Copy
[`settings.example.json`](./settings.example.json) and set `primaryProject`:

```json
{
  "basicMemory": {
    "primaryProject": "my-project",
    "captureFolder": "sessions"
  }
}
```

The block can also live in your **user-level** settings. When
`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` is present, its literal value is the user configuration
directory and `settings.json` is read below it. An empty, whitespace, relative,
or tilde-prefixed value is preserved exactly, matching Claude Code. When the
variable is absent, the user settings path is `~/.claude/settings.json`. One
user-level block covers every project, with no per-repo setup. Precedence, lowest
to highest: user-level `settings.json` → project `settings.json` → project
`settings.local.json`, merged per key — so a project that pins its own
`primaryProject` wins over the user-level default. (This mirrors Claude Code's
own sources: `settings.local.json` is project-scoped only, so there is no
user-level `settings.local.json`.) The hooks resolve the project settings from
the nearest ancestor directory (including the working directory) whose `.claude`
folder contains a `settings.json` or `settings.local.json`, so a mapping in the
repo root still applies when Claude starts in a subdirectory.

To enable the capture reflexes, also set `"outputStyle": "basic-memory"` in your
settings (or select it via `/config`).

| Key | Default | What it does |
|-----|---------|--------------|
| `primaryProject` | _(default project)_ | Where briefs read from and checkpoints write to |
| `captureFolder` | `sessions` | Folder for PreCompact checkpoint notes |
| `recallTimeframe` | `3d` | Recency window for the session brief |
| `recallPrompt` | _(built-in)_ | The instruction appended to the brief |
| `preCompactCapture` | `extractive` | How checkpoints are produced |
| `sessionProfile` | `general` | `coding` makes checkpoints schema-backed `coding_session` notes with required Git identity |
| `repository` | _(none)_ | User-confirmed stable repository identifier (`owner/name`); required for the `coding` profile |
| `captureEvents` | `true` | Record bounded lifecycle-event envelopes to the local inbox (see `basic-memory hook status` / `flush`). Set the JSON boolean `false` to disable it; other values fail closed. |

The plugin seeds schemas for notes the Claude integration writes directly:
`decision`, `task`, and the session type relevant to the selected profile. A
general setup seeds `session`; a **coding setup** (persisted as
`sessionProfile: "coding"` with a user-confirmed `repository`) seeds
`coding_session`, whose required repository, repo-root, working-directory,
branch, and Git SHA frontmatter make checkpoints queryable by structured
filters; typed pull-request fields are added when a PR exists. Lifecycle-event
envelopes are operational trace rather than knowledge; `bm hook flush` archives
them locally and never creates session or tool-ledger notes.

To customize how Claude writes memory, edit `skills/bm-writing/SKILL.md` in the
plugin source. `bm-remember` and the output style's capture reflexes apply that
shared standard while retaining their own schemas and evidence requirements.

See [DESIGN.md](./DESIGN.md) for the complete configuration schema, the
Claude-Code-project ↔ Basic-Memory-project mapping, and team-workspace behavior.

## Teams

If you're on Basic Memory Cloud with a team workspace, the plugin reads team context
into your session brief and gives you a deliberate way to publish back — **without
ever auto-writing to the shared graph.**

- **Read across** — add team projects to `secondaryProjects`. SessionStart pulls their
  open decisions into your brief (in parallel, read-only), so you start oriented on
  what the team has decided.
- **Capture stays personal** — session checkpoints and `/basic-memory:bm-remember` only
  ever write to your `primaryProject`. Nothing lands in a team project automatically.
- **Share deliberately** — `/basic-memory:bm-share` copies a chosen note into a
  `teamProjects` target (with attribution and a confirmation step). That's the only
  path to a shared write.

Because project names repeat across workspaces, team refs must be **workspace-qualified**
(`my-team/notes`) or `external_id` UUIDs — `/basic-memory:bm-setup` fills these in for you
from `list_workspaces`.

## Development

From the monorepo root:

```bash
just package-check-claude-code
```

From this directory:

```bash
just check
```

`just check` validates the manifests, hooks, output style, and seed schemas, then
runs `claude plugin validate . --strict`.
