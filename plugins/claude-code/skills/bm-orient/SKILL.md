# Orient From Basic Memory

Use this before substantial work in a repo, before resuming an old thread, or when
the user asks where things stand. The SessionStart hook already briefs the start
of a session; this is the deliberate mid-session version with deeper reads.

## Steps

1. Resolve config: read the `basicMemory` block with the same precedence the
   hooks use. For the user-level base, append `settings.json` to the literal value
   of `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` when that environment variable is present; do not trim
   it, expand `~`, or treat an empty value as unset. Use `~/.claude/settings.json`
   only when the variable is absent. Then the project's `.claude/settings.json`
   and `.claude/settings.local.json` override it per key. Use `primaryProject`,
   `secondaryProjects`, `recallTimeframe`, `sessionProfile`, `repository`, and
   `placementConventions`. If no config is present, continue against the default
   Basic Memory project and mention that setup has not been run. Scope queries to
   `primaryProject` by passing it as `project`, or as `project_id` if it's an
   `external_id` UUID.

2. Query the primary project with `search_notes`:
   - active tasks: `metadata_filters={"type": "task", "status": "active"}`
   - open decisions: `metadata_filters={"type": "decision", "status": "open"}`
   - recent sessions: `metadata_filters={"type": "session"}`, after
     `recallTimeframe`
   - recent coding sessions: `metadata_filters={"type": "coding_session",
     "repository": "<configured repository>"}`, after `recallTimeframe`, when
     `sessionProfile` is `coding`

   Always query `"type": "session"`; include `"type": "coding_session"` for a
   coding profile only with the configured `repository` metadata filter.
   Never run an unscoped coding-session query; if the repository is missing,
   report that setup is incomplete. Merge and deduplicate the results, sort them
   newest first, and prefer the highest-signal checkpoint regardless of which
   producer wrote it. `coding_session` carries schema-required, queryable Git
   context; `session` covers general checkpoints and PreCompact captures. Do not
   query lifecycle trace: `bm hook flush` archives it locally rather than
   promoting it into the graph.

3. Query configured `secondaryProjects` read-only for open decisions. Do not write
   to shared projects during orientation.

4. Read the highest-signal hits before summarizing. Prefer notes that match the
   current repository, branch, Git SHA, pull request, named route, issue, or file
   path. For coding sessions, use structured metadata filters before text search.

5. Present a compact orientation:
   - active work
   - decisions that constrain the next move
   - recent checkpoint cursor
   - likely next action
   - any missing setup or ambiguous project mapping

Keep the summary evidence-backed. Include permalinks for notes you rely on.
