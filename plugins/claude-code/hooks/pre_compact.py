"""PreCompact hook — the entire hook. All logic (settings resolution, the
extractive checkpoint note, lifecycle-envelope capture) lives in the released
basic-memory package behind `basic-memory hook pre-compact`; this script is
only the launcher, and uv resolves the dependency floor declared above.
scripts/update_versions.py bumps that floor at release time.

BM_BIN overrides the uv-managed environment for development: either a path
to a bm binary, or a POSIX-quoted launcher string like `uvx "basic-memory"`.

Fail-open contract: a hook must never disrupt an agent session, so every
failure path — unresolvable dependencies, a broken BM_BIN, a crash inside
the CLI — exits 0. The hook JSON on stdin passes through untouched.
