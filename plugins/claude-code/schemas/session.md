# Session

A **SessionNote** is a resume checkpoint. Basic Memory host integrations
write these at their supported lifecycle boundaries or on an explicit checkpoint
request. It records what the
session was doing so the next session can pick up where this one left off.

Sessions are found by the SessionStart hook via structured recall:
`search_notes(metadata_filters={"type": "session"}, after_date="3d")`.

In a **coding setup** (`sessionProfile: "coding"`), checkpoints use the Coding
Session schema instead — it adds required, queryable Git identity
(`repository`, `branch`, `git_sha`, pull-request fields). This schema stays the
general-purpose checkpoint.

## What goes in a SessionNote

- **summary** — a short paragraph of what happened (richer once summarized
  checkpoints replace the extractive first cut).
- **context** / **next_step** — the cursor: what's in flight and what to do next.
- **decision** / **problem** — choices made and dead-ends hit, so the next
  session doesn't repeat them.
- **produced** — relations to the notes this session created or changed.

## Frontmatter

`type: session` and `status` are the queryable fields that power recall. `warn`
validation means a missing field is surfaced, never blocking — the user's flow
is never gated on schema conformance.
