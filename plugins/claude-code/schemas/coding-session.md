# Coding Session

A **CodingSession** is a resumable engineering checkpoint whose repository
identity is structured and queryable. Required Git fields make it possible to
find the exact work cursor without parsing prose.

Examples:

`search_notes(note_types=["coding_session"], metadata_filters={"repository": "owner/repo"})`

`search_notes(note_types=["coding_session"], metadata_filters={"pull_request_number": "123"})`

`search_notes(note_types=["coding_session"], metadata_filters={"agent": "codex", "session_id": "<id>"})`

Pull-request fields are optional because valid coding work can precede a pull
request. When a pull request exists, checkpoint writers populate the complete
pull-request field set. Multiple checkpoints from one agent chat share the
`agent` and `session_id` pair; session IDs alone are not cross-agent identity.
Each new checkpoint can link to its verified predecessor with
`continues [[Previous checkpoint title]]`. New writers use the shared fields.
Legacy agent-specific session fields remain accepted for existing notes; do not
rewrite old checkpoints or infer missing session IDs.
