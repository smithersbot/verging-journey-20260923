"""Tool-use model seam for the agent-task eval (basic-memory#1401).

The single-prompt ``LLMRunner`` seam in ``runners.py`` cannot pause at a tool
call, so the agent under test speaks a richer contract: the model receives a
neutral transcript plus tool definitions and returns either tool calls or a
final answer. Two transports:

- ``openai-compat``: any ``/chat/completions`` endpoint that implements the
  ``tools`` parameter (Ollama, vLLM, LM Studio, OpenAI — and Anthropic models
  behind a LiteLLM proxy).
- ``scripted``: a canned JSON script for offline tests and the LLM-free smoke.

``claude:<model>`` is deliberately unsupported here: ``claude -p`` runs its own
agent loop with ``--max-turns 1`` semantics and never hands a ``tool_use``
block back to the harness.
