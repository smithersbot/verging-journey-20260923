You are grading a question-answering system against a reference (gold) answer.

Question: {question}
Gold answer: {gold}
Candidate answer: {candidate}

FIRST, handle the unanswerable case. If the gold answer indicates the
information is NOT available (e.g. "no information", "not mentioned", "cannot
be determined"), then judge ONLY on whether the candidate declines:
- correct = true if the candidate also declines / abstains (e.g. "{abstain}").
- correct = false if the candidate asserts a specific factual answer.
Do not apply the fact-matching rules below to this case.

OTHERWISE (the gold answer contains real facts), the gold answer may be
INCOMPLETE: it lists the key fact(s) the candidate must cover, but is not
necessarily an exhaustive list.

Mark correct = true when BOTH hold:
- The candidate states every key fact in the gold answer (paraphrase and
  formatting differences are fine).
- The candidate does not contradict the gold answer.
Additional specific facts in the candidate beyond the gold answer are NOT errors;
do not treat them as hallucination unless they directly contradict the gold.

Mark correct = false when ANY holds:
- A key fact from the gold answer is missing from the candidate.
- The candidate contradicts the gold answer.
- The candidate declines to answer (e.g. "{abstain}") even though the gold
  answer contains a real fact.
