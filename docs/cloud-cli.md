# Basic Memory Cloud CLI Guide

The Basic Memory Cloud CLI provides seamless integration between local and cloud knowledge bases using **project-scoped synchronization**. Each project can optionally sync with the cloud, giving you fine-grained control over what syncs and where.

## Overview

The cloud CLI enables you to:
- **Authenticate cloud access** - OAuth/API key credentials are stored locally for cloud operations
- **Project-scoped sync** - Each project independently manages its sync configuration
- **Explicit operations** - Sync only what you want, when you want
- **Team-safe push/pull** - Additive, git-style transfers that work on shared Team workspaces
- **Bidirectional sync** - Keep local and cloud in sync with rclone bisync (Personal workspaces)
- **Offline access** - Work locally, sync when ready

### Personal vs Team workspaces

The transfer commands fall into two groups:

| Command | Direction | Behavior | Personal | Team |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `bm cloud pull` | cloud → local | **additive** — never deletes local | ✅ | ✅ |
| `bm cloud push` | local → cloud | **additive** — never deletes cloud | ✅ | ✅ |
| `bm cloud sync` | local → cloud | **mirror** — deletes cloud files missing locally | ✅ | ❌ |
| `bm cloud bisync` | local ↔ cloud | **mirror** — two-way, deletes on both sides | ✅ | ❌ |

`sync` and `bisync` are mirror operations: one local tree becomes authoritative and files missing on the other side get deleted. That is correct for a Personal workspace (one user, one source of truth) but unsafe on a shared Team bucket, where it could delete a teammate's files. On Team workspaces these commands exit early with a clear error and point you at `push`/`pull`.

`push` and `pull` are additive (they use `rclone copy`, which never deletes on the destination), so they are safe on both Personal and Team workspaces.

## Prerequisites

Before using Basic Memory Cloud, you need:

- **Active Subscription**: An active Basic Memory Cloud subscription is required to access cloud features
- **Subscribe**: Visit [https://basicmemory.com/pricing](https://basicmemory.com/pricing) to sign up
- **Optional**: Cloud is optional. Local-first open-source usage continues without cloud.
- **OSS Discount**: Use code `{{OSS_DISCOUNT_CODE}}` for 20% off for 3 months.

If you attempt to log in without an active subscription, you'll receive a "Subscription Required" error with a link to subscribe.

## Architecture: Project-Scoped Sync

### The Problem

**Old approach (SPEC-8):** All projects lived in a single `~/basic-memory-cloud-sync/` directory. This caused:
- ❌ Directory conflicts between mount and bisync
- ❌ Auto-discovery creating phantom projects
- ❌ Confusion about what syncs and when
- ❌ All-or-nothing sync (couldn't sync just one project)

**New approach (SPEC-20):** Each project independently configures sync.

### How It Works

**Projects can exist in three states:**

1. **Cloud-only** - Project exists on cloud, no local copy
2. **Cloud + Local (synced)** - Project has a local working directory that syncs
3. **Local-only** - Project exists locally and is not routed to cloud

**Example:**

```bash
# You have 3 projects on cloud:
# - research: wants local sync at ~/Documents/research
# - work: wants local sync at ~/work-notes
# - temp: cloud-only, no local sync needed

bm project add research --cloud --local-path ~/Documents/research
bm project add work --cloud --local-path ~/work-notes
bm project add temp --cloud  # No local sync

# Now you can sync individually (after initial --resync):
bm cloud bisync --name research
bm cloud bisync --name work
# temp stays cloud-only
```

**What happens under the covers:**
- Config stores `cloud_projects` dict mapping project names to local paths
- Each project gets its own bisync state in `~/.basic-memory/bisync-state/{project}/`
- Rclone syncs using single remote: `basic-memory-cloud`
- Projects can live anywhere on your filesystem, not forced into sync directory

## Quick Start

### 1. Authenticate Cloud Access

Authenticate with cloud:

```bash
bm cloud login
```

**What this does:**
1. Opens browser to Basic Memory Cloud authentication page
2. Stores authentication tokens in `~/.basic-memory/basic-memory-cloud.json`
3. Validates your subscription status
4. Leaves routing behavior unchanged (auth only)

**Result:** Cloud credentials are available for cloud-routed commands.
Apply OSS discount code `{{OSS_DISCOUNT_CODE}}` during checkout to receive 20% off for 3 months.

### 2. Set Up Sync

Install rclone and configure credentials:

```bash
bm cloud setup
```

**What this does:**
1. Installs rclone with a supported package manager (if needed)
2. Fetches your tenant information from cloud
3. Generates scoped S3 credentials for sync
4. Configures single rclone remote: `basic-memory-cloud`

**Result:** You're ready to sync projects. No sync directories created yet - those come with project setup.

Rclone setup uses package managers such as Homebrew, MacPorts, apt, dnf, yum, pacman,
zypper, snap, winget, Chocolatey, or Scoop when available. It does not run remote
install scripts with `sudo`; if no supported package manager is found, the CLI prints
manual install instructions.

### 3. Add Projects with Sync

Create projects with optional local sync paths:

```bash
# Create cloud project without local sync
bm project add research --cloud

# Create cloud project WITH local sync
bm project add research --cloud --local-path ~/Documents/research

# Or configure sync for existing project
bm cloud sync-setup research ~/Documents/research
```

**What happens under the covers:**

When you add a project with `--local-path`:
1. Project created on cloud at `/app/data/research`
2. Local path stored in config for that project (`local_sync_path`)
3. Local directory created if it doesn't exist
4. Bisync state directory created at `~/.basic-memory/bisync-state/research/`

**Result:** Project is ready to sync, but no files synced yet.

### 4. Sync Your Project

Establish the initial sync baseline. **Best practice:** Always preview with `--dry-run` first:

```bash
# Step 1: Preview the initial sync (recommended)
bm cloud bisync --name research --resync --dry-run

# Step 2: If all looks good, run the actual sync
bm cloud bisync --name research --resync
```

**What happens under the covers:**
1. Rclone reads from `~/Documents/research` (local)
2. Connects to `basic-memory-cloud:bucket-name/app/data/research` (remote)
3. Creates bisync state files in `~/.basic-memory/bisync-state/research/`
4. Syncs files bidirectionally with settings:
   - `conflict_resolve=newer` (most recent wins)
   - `max_delete=25` (safety limit)
   - Respects `.bmignore` patterns

**Result:** Local and cloud are in sync. Baseline established.

**Why `--resync`?** This is an rclone requirement for the first bisync run. It establishes the initial state that future syncs will compare against. After the first sync, never use `--resync` unless you need to force a new baseline.

See: https://rclone.org/bisync/#resync
```
--resync
This will effectively make both Path1 and Path2 filesystems contain a matching superset of all files. By default, Path2 files that do not exist in Path1 will be copied to Path1, and the process will then copy the Path1 tree to Path2.
```

### 5. Subsequent Syncs

After the first sync, just run bisync without `--resync`:

```bash
bm cloud bisync --name research
```

**What happens:**
1. Rclone compares local and cloud states
2. Syncs changes in both directions
3. Auto-resolves conflicts (newer file wins)
4. Updates `last_sync` timestamp in config

**Result:** Changes flow both ways - edit locally or in cloud, both stay in sync.

### 6. Verify Setup

Check status:

```bash
bm cloud status
```

You should see:
- `OAuth: token valid` (or missing/expired)
- `API Key: configured` (or not set)
- `Cloud instance is healthy`
- Instructions for project sync commands

## Working with Projects

### Understanding Project Commands

**Key concept:** Use regular `bm project` commands (not `bm cloud project`).

```bash
# Local route
bm project list --local
bm project add research ~/Documents/research

# Cloud route
bm project list --cloud
bm project add research --cloud
```

### Creating Projects

**Use case 1: Cloud-only project (no local sync)**

```bash
bm project add temp-notes --cloud
```

**What this does:**
- Creates project on cloud at `/app/data/temp-notes`
- No local directory created
- No sync configuration

**Result:** Project exists on cloud, accessible via MCP tools, but no local copy.

**Use case 2: Cloud project with local sync**

```bash
bm project add research --cloud --local-path ~/Documents/research
```

**What this does:**
- Creates project on cloud at `/app/data/research`
- Creates local directory `~/Documents/research`
- Stores sync config in `~/.basic-memory/config.json`
- Prepares for bisync (but doesn't sync yet)

**Result:** Project ready to sync. Run `bm cloud bisync --name research --resync` to establish baseline.

**Use case 3: Add sync to existing cloud project**

```bash
# Project already exists on cloud
bm cloud sync-setup research ~/Documents/research
```

**What this does:**
- Updates existing project's sync configuration
- Creates local directory
- Prepares for bisync

**Result:** Existing cloud project now has local sync path. Run bisync to pull files down.

### Listing Projects

View all projects:

```bash
bm project list
```

**What you see:**
- Local projects always
- Cloud projects when credentials are available
- Default project marked
- Route-related metadata (for example, local/cloud presence and sync info)

Example shape (single row for dual-presence projects):

```text
Name   Path            Local Path           Cloud Path   CLI Default   MCP (stdio)
main   /basic-memory   ~/basic-memory       /basic-memory   local       local
specs  /specs          ~/dev/specs          /specs          cloud       local
```

### When a Project Exists in Both Local and Cloud

Use routing flags to disambiguate command targets:

```bash
# Force local target for this command
bm project info main --local
bm project ls --name main --local

# Force cloud target for this command
bm project info main --cloud
bm project ls --name main --cloud
```

Default behavior for no-project, no-flag commands is local.
For MCP stdio, routing is always local.

## File Synchronization

### Understanding the Sync Commands

**There are five sync-related commands:**

| Command | Direction | Workspace | Summary |
|---|---|---|---|
| `bm cloud pull` | cloud → local | Personal + Team | Fetch cloud changes, additively (git-style) |
| `bm cloud push` | local → cloud | Personal + Team | Upload local changes, additively (git-style) |
| `bm cloud sync` | local → cloud | Personal only | One-way mirror (cloud becomes identical to local) |
| `bm cloud bisync` | local ↔ cloud | Personal only | Two-way mirror (recommended for solo use) |
| `bm cloud check` | — | Personal only | Verify mirror integrity (no changes) |

If you collaborate on a shared Team workspace, use **`push`/`pull`** (see [Team Workspaces](#team-workspaces-push--pull-additive-git-style)). If you are the only writer (a Personal workspace), the mirror commands `sync`/`bisync` give you a single source of truth.

### Team Workspaces: push / pull (additive, git-style)

`push` and `pull` are the Team-safe transfer commands. They model `git push` / `git pull`:

- **`bm cloud pull`** fetches changes from the cloud into your local directory.
- **`bm cloud push`** uploads your local changes to the cloud.

Both use `rclone copy`, so they are **additive — they never delete on the destination**. A conflict (a file that differs on both sides) is never resolved silently: by default the command aborts and lists the conflicting files, exactly like git refusing to clobber your changes.

#### Pull: fetch cloud changes

```bash
# Preview first (recommended)
bm cloud pull --name research --dry-run

# Fetch new/changed cloud files into local
bm cloud pull --name research
```

**What happens:**
1. Compares cloud and local with `rclone check`
2. Downloads files that are new or changed on the cloud
3. Leaves your local-only files untouched (never deletes local)
4. If any file differs on both sides, aborts and lists the conflicts (unless you pass `--on-conflict`)

#### Push: upload local changes

```bash
bm cloud push --name research --dry-run
bm cloud push --name research
```

**What happens:**
1. Compares local and cloud with `rclone check`
2. Uploads files that are new or changed locally
3. Leaves cloud-only files untouched (never deletes cloud)
4. If any file differs on both sides, aborts and lists the conflicts — pull first, like a rejected `git push`

#### Resolving conflicts

When `push`/`pull` reports conflicts, re-run with `--on-conflict` to choose how differing files are handled. The value names exactly what survives, so it reads the same in both directions:

| `--on-conflict` | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `fail` *(default)* | List the conflicting files and exit without transferring anything |
| `keep-cloud` | Take the cloud version (pull: overwrite local; push: skip those files) |
| `keep-local` | Keep the local version (pull: skip those files; push: overwrite cloud) |
| `keep-both` | Keep both — write the incoming version beside the existing one as `name.conflict-<date>.md` |

```bash
# A teammate edited notes you also changed locally — pull reports a conflict:
bm cloud pull --name research
# pull aborted: 1 file(s) differ between local and cloud.
#   * notes/decisions.md
# Re-run with one of: --on-conflict keep-cloud | keep-local | keep-both

# Take the cloud copy:
bm cloud pull --name research --on-conflict keep-cloud

# Or keep both versions to merge by hand:
bm cloud pull --name research --on-conflict keep-both
```

#### Limitations

`push`/`pull` are deliberately simple, conflict-aware byte transfers — not a full reconciler. Without a sync baseline:

- **Deletions are not propagated.** A note deleted on one side is not removed from the other (we cannot tell an intentional delete from a file the other side never had). This is surfaced in the command output.
- **Every divergence is treated as a conflict.** We cannot tell a teammate's edit from your stale copy, so any differing file prompts a decision rather than auto-resolving.

For conflict-aware *editing*, write through the MCP/API tools (which merge at the note level). A Team-safe bidirectional reconciler with a real baseline is tracked in [issue #862](https://github.com/basicmachines-co/basic-memory/issues/862).

### One-Way Sync: Local → Cloud (Personal only)

**Use case:** You made changes locally and want to push to cloud (overwrite cloud).

> **Personal workspaces only.** `sync` is a destructive mirror — it deletes cloud files that are not present locally. On a Team workspace it would delete a teammate's files, so it is blocked there. Use `bm cloud push` (additive) on Team workspaces.

```bash
bm cloud sync --name research
```

**What happens:**
1. Reads files from `~/Documents/research` (local)
2. Uses rclone sync to make cloud identical to local
3. Respects `.bmignore` patterns
4. Shows progress bar

**Result:** Cloud now matches local exactly. Any cloud-only changes are overwritten.

**When to use:**
- You know local is the source of truth
- You want to force cloud to match local
- You don't care about cloud changes

### Two-Way Sync: Local ↔ Cloud (Personal only, recommended for solo use)

**Use case:** You edit files both locally and in cloud UI, want both to stay in sync.

> **Personal workspaces only.** `bisync` is a two-way mirror that can delete and overwrite on both sides. It is blocked on Team workspaces — use `bm cloud pull` then `bm cloud push` there. A Team-safe bidirectional reconciler is tracked separately ([issue #862](https://github.com/basicmachines-co/basic-memory/issues/862)).

```bash
# First time - establish baseline
bm cloud bisync --name research --resync

# Subsequent syncs
bm cloud bisync --name research
```

**What happens:**
1. Compares local and cloud states using bisync metadata
2. Syncs changes in both directions
3. Auto-resolves conflicts (newer file wins)
4. Detects excessive deletes and fails safely (max 25 files)

**Conflict resolution example:**

```bash
# Edit locally
echo "Local change" > ~/Documents/research/notes.md

# Edit same file in cloud UI
# Cloud now has: "Cloud change"

# Run bisync
bm cloud bisync --name research

# Result: Newer file wins (based on modification time)
# If cloud was more recent, cloud version kept
# If local was more recent, local version kept
```

**When to use:**
- Default workflow for most users
- You edit in multiple places
- You want automatic conflict resolution

### Verify Sync Integrity (Personal only)

**Use case:** Check if local and cloud match without making changes.

> **Personal workspaces only.** `check` compares against the Personal workspace mirror remote, like `sync`/`bisync`. On Team workspaces use `bm cloud pull --dry-run` / `bm cloud push --dry-run` to preview differences instead.

```bash
bm cloud check --name research
```

**What happens:**
1. Compares file checksums between local and cloud
2. Reports differences
3. No files transferred

**Result:** Shows which files differ. Run bisync to sync them.

```bash
# One-way check (faster)
bm cloud check --name research --one-way
```

### Preview Changes (Dry Run)

**Use case:** See what would change without actually syncing.

```bash
bm cloud bisync --name research --dry-run
```

**What happens:**
1. Runs bisync logic
2. Shows what would be transferred/deleted
3. No actual changes made

**Result:** Safe preview of sync operations.

### Advanced: List Project Files by Route

**Use case:** Inspect local or cloud project files explicitly.

```bash
# List local project files (default target when no route flag is given)
bm project ls --name research
bm project ls --name research --local

# List cloud project files
bm project ls --name research --cloud

# List files in subdirectory
bm project ls --name research --cloud --path subfolder
```

**What happens:**
1. Resolves route from flags (or local default when no route is given)
2. Lists files for the chosen project instance
3. No files transferred

**Result:** See file listing for the target route.

## Multiple Projects

### Syncing Multiple Projects

**Use case:** You have several projects with local sync, want to sync all at once.

```bash
# Setup multiple projects
bm project add research --cloud --local-path ~/Documents/research
bm project add work --cloud --local-path ~/work-notes
bm project add personal --cloud --local-path ~/personal

# Establish baselines
bm cloud bisync --name research --resync
bm cloud bisync --name work --resync
bm cloud bisync --name personal --resync

# Daily workflow: sync everything
bm cloud bisync --name research
bm cloud bisync --name work
bm cloud bisync --name personal
```

**Future:** `--all` flag will sync all configured projects:

```bash
bm cloud bisync --all  # Coming soon
```

### Mixed Usage

**Use case:** Some projects sync, some stay cloud-only.

```bash
# Projects with sync
bm project add research --cloud --local-path ~/Documents/research
bm project add work --cloud --local-path ~/work

# Cloud-only projects
bm project add archive --cloud
bm project add temp-notes --cloud

# Sync only the configured ones
bm cloud bisync --name research
bm cloud bisync --name work

# Archive and temp-notes stay cloud-only
```

**Result:** Fine-grained control over what syncs.

## Per-Project Cloud Routing (API Key)

Route individual projects through cloud using an API key. This lets you keep some projects local while others route through cloud.

### Setting Up API Key Auth

**Option A: Create a key in the web app, then save it locally:**

```bash
bm cloud set-key bmc_abc123...
```

**Option B: Create a key via CLI (requires OAuth login first):**

```bash
bm cloud login                     # One-time OAuth login
bm cloud create-key "my-laptop"    # Creates key and saves it locally
```

The API key is account-level — it grants access to all your cloud projects. It's stored in `~/.basic-memory/config.json` as `cloud_api_key`.
On POSIX systems, Basic Memory writes `~/.basic-memory/` as user-private (`0700`) and
`config.json` as user-read/write only (`0600`). Treat this config file as a credential
file when an API key is saved.

### Setting Project Modes

```bash
# Route a project through cloud
bm project set-cloud research

# Revert to local mode
bm project set-local research

# View project modes
bm project list
```

**What happens:**
- `set-cloud`: validates the API key exists, then sets the project mode to `cloud` in config
- `set-local`: reverts the project to local mode (removes the mode entry from config)
- MCP tools and CLI commands for that project will route to `cloud_host/proxy` with the API key as Bearer token

### How It Works

When an MCP tool or CLI command runs for a cloud-mode project:

1. `get_client(project_name="research")` checks the project's mode in config
2. If mode is `cloud`, creates an HTTP client pointed at `cloud_host/proxy` with `Authorization: Bearer bmc_...`
3. If mode is `local` (default), uses the in-process ASGI transport as usual

**Routing priority** (highest to lowest):
1. Factory injection (cloud app, tests)
2. Explicit route override (`--local` / `--cloud`)
3. Per-project cloud mode (API key)
4. Local ASGI transport (default)

Route override environment variables:
- `BASIC_MEMORY_FORCE_LOCAL=true`
- `BASIC_MEMORY_FORCE_CLOUD=true`
- `BASIC_MEMORY_EXPLICIT_ROUTING=true`

No-project, no-flag CLI commands default to local routing.

### Configuration Example

```json
{
  "projects": {
    "personal": "/Users/me/notes",
    "research": "/Users/me/research"
  },
  "project_modes": {
    "research": "cloud"
  },
  "cloud_api_key": "bmc_abc123...",
  "cloud_host": "https://cloud.basicmemory.com",
  "default_project": "personal"
}
```

In this example, `personal` stays local and `research` routes through cloud. Projects not listed in `project_modes` default to local.

### Sync Behavior

Cloud-mode projects are automatically skipped during local file sync (background sync and file watching). Their files live on the cloud instance, not locally.

## OAuth Logout

```bash
bm cloud logout
```

**What this does:**
1. Removes stored OAuth token(s)
2. Does not change per-project route configuration
3. Does not change command routing defaults

**Result:** OAuth session is cleared. API-key-based routing still works if `cloud_api_key` is configured.

## Filter Configuration

### Understanding .bmignore

**The problem:** You don't want to sync everything (e.g., `.git`, `node_modules`, database files).

**The solution:** `.bmignore` file with gitignore-style patterns.

**Location:** `~/.basic-memory/.bmignore`

**Default patterns:**

```gitignore
# Hidden files and directories
.*

# Basic Memory internals
*.db
*.db-shm
*.db-wal
config.json

# Version control
.git
.svn

# Python
__pycache__
*.pyc
*.pyo
*.pyd
.pytest_cache
.coverage
*.egg-info
.tox
.mypy_cache
.ruff_cache

# Virtual environments
.venv
venv
env
.env

# Node.js
node_modules

# Build artifacts
build
dist
.cache

# IDE
.idea
.vscode

# OS files
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db
desktop.ini

# Obsidian
.obsidian

# Temporary files
*.tmp
*.swp
*.swo
*~
```

**How it works:**
1. On first sync, `.bmignore` created with defaults
2. Patterns converted to rclone filter format (`.bmignore.rclone`)
3. Rclone uses filters during sync
4. Same patterns used by all projects

During conversion, file patterns exclude the direct match and recursive contents.
For example, `config.json` becomes both `- config.json` and `- config.json/**`,
while `.*` becomes both `- .*` and `- .*/**`. Directory-only patterns keep
their trailing slash, so `cache/` becomes `- cache/` and `- cache/**`.

**Customizing:**

```bash
# Edit patterns
code ~/.basic-memory/.bmignore

# Add custom patterns
echo "*.tmp" >> ~/.basic-memory/.bmignore

# Next sync uses updated patterns
bm cloud bisync --name research
```

## Troubleshooting

### Rclone Setup Cannot Install Automatically

**Problem:** `bm cloud setup` cannot find a supported package manager, or package-manager
installation fails.

**Explanation:** The CLI avoids remote privileged install scripts. It only invokes known
package managers and otherwise asks you to install rclone manually.

**Solution:** Install rclone with your OS package manager, then rerun setup:

```bash
# macOS
brew install rclone

# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt install rclone

# Fedora
sudo dnf install rclone

# Arch
sudo pacman -S rclone

# After rclone is on PATH
bm cloud setup
```

### Authentication Issues

**Problem:** "Authentication failed" or "Invalid token"

**Solution:** Re-authenticate:

```bash
bm cloud logout
bm cloud login
```

### Subscription Issues

**Problem:** "Subscription Required" error

**Solution:**
1. Visit subscribe URL shown in error
2. Sign up for subscription
3. Run `bm cloud login` again

**Note:** Access is immediate when subscription becomes active.

### Bisync Initialization

**Problem:** "First bisync requires --resync"

**Explanation:** Bisync needs a baseline state before it can sync changes.

**Solution:**

```bash
bm cloud bisync --name research --resync
```

**What this does:**
- Establishes initial sync state
- Creates baseline in `~/.basic-memory/bisync-state/research/`
- Syncs all files bidirectionally

**Result:** Future syncs work without `--resync`.

### Empty Directory Issues

**Problem:** "Empty prior Path1 listing. Cannot sync to an empty directory"

**Explanation:** Rclone bisync doesn't work well with completely empty directories. It needs at least one file to establish a baseline.

**Solution:** Add at least one file before running `--resync`:

```bash
# Create a placeholder file
echo "# Research Notes" > ~/Documents/research/README.md

# Now run bisync
bm cloud bisync --name research --resync
```

**Why this happens:** Bisync creates listing files that track the state of each side. When both directories are completely empty, these listing files are considered invalid by rclone.

**Best practice:** Always have at least one file (like a README.md) in your project directory before setting up sync.

### Bisync State Corruption

**Problem:** Bisync fails with errors about corrupted state or listing files

**Explanation:** Sometimes bisync state can become inconsistent (e.g., after mixing dry-run and actual runs, or after manual file operations).

**Solution:** Clear bisync state and re-establish baseline:

```bash
# Clear bisync state
bm cloud bisync-reset research

# Re-establish baseline
bm cloud bisync --name research --resync
```

**What this does:**
- Removes all bisync metadata from `~/.basic-memory/bisync-state/research/`
- Forces fresh baseline on next `--resync`
- Safe operation (doesn't touch your files)

**Note:** This command also runs automatically when you remove a project to clean up state directories.

### Too Many Deletes

**Problem:** "Error: max delete limit (25) exceeded"

**Explanation:** Bisync detected you're about to delete more than 25 files. This is a safety check to prevent accidents.

**Solution 1:** Review what you're deleting, then force resync:

```bash
# Check what would be deleted
bm cloud bisync --name research --dry-run

# If correct, establish new baseline
bm cloud bisync --name research --resync
```

**Solution 2:** Use one-way sync if you know local is correct:

```bash
bm cloud sync --name research
```

### Project Not Configured for Sync

**Problem:** "Project research has no local_sync_path configured"

**Explanation:** Project exists on cloud but has no local sync path.

**Solution:**

```bash
bm cloud sync-setup research ~/Documents/research
bm cloud bisync --name research --resync
```

### Connection Issues

**Problem:** "Cannot connect to cloud instance"

**Solution:** Check status:

```bash
bm cloud status
```

If instance is down, wait a few minutes and retry.

## Security

- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.1 with PKCE flow
- **Tokens**: Stored securely in `~/.basic-memory/basic-memory-cloud.json`
- **API keys**: Stored in `~/.basic-memory/config.json`, which is written with private file permissions on POSIX systems
- **Transport**: All data encrypted in transit (HTTPS)
- **Credentials**: Scoped S3 credentials (read-write to your tenant only)
- **Rclone setup**: Uses package managers or manual instructions; no remote privileged install-script fallback
- **Isolation**: Your data isolated from other tenants
- **Ignore patterns**: Sensitive files automatically excluded via `.bmignore`

## Command Reference

### Cloud Authentication

```bash
bm cloud login              # Authenticate and store OAuth credentials
bm cloud logout             # Remove stored OAuth credentials
bm cloud status             # Check auth state and instance health
bm cloud promo --off        # Disable CLI cloud promo notices
```

### API Key Management

```bash
bm cloud set-key <key>      # Save a cloud API key (bmc_ prefixed)
bm cloud create-key <name>  # Create API key via cloud API (requires OAuth login)
```

### Setup

```bash
bm cloud setup              # Install rclone via package manager and configure credentials
```

### Project Management

```bash
bm project list --local                   # Local project list
bm project list --cloud                   # Cloud project list
bm project add <name> --cloud             # Create cloud project (no sync)
bm project add <name> --cloud --local-path <path> # Create with local sync
bm cloud sync-setup <name> <path>       # Add sync to existing project
bm project rm <name>                      # Delete project
```

### Per-Project Routing

```bash
bm project set-cloud <name>  # Route project through cloud (requires API key)
bm project set-local <name>  # Revert project to local mode
```

### File Synchronization

```bash
# Pull: fetch cloud changes (cloud → local) - Personal + Team, additive
bm cloud pull --name <project>
bm cloud pull --name <project> --dry-run
bm cloud pull --name <project> --on-conflict [fail|keep-local|keep-cloud|keep-both]

# Push: upload local changes (local → cloud) - Personal + Team, additive
bm cloud push --name <project>
bm cloud push --name <project> --dry-run
bm cloud push --name <project> --on-conflict [fail|keep-local|keep-cloud|keep-both]

# One-way mirror (local → cloud) - Personal workspaces only
bm cloud sync --name <project>
bm cloud sync --name <project> --dry-run
bm cloud sync --name <project> --verbose

# Two-way mirror (local ↔ cloud) - Personal workspaces only
bm cloud bisync --name <project>          # After first --resync
bm cloud bisync --name <project> --resync # First time / force baseline
bm cloud bisync --name <project> --dry-run
bm cloud bisync --name <project> --verbose

# Integrity check - Personal workspaces only
bm cloud check --name <project>
bm cloud check --name <project> --one-way

# List project files by route
bm project ls --name <project>          # Default target: local
bm project ls --name <project> --local
bm project ls --name <project> --cloud
bm project ls --name <project> --cloud --path <subpath>
```

## Summary

**Basic Memory Cloud uses project-scoped sync:**

1. **Authenticate cloud access** - `bm cloud login`
2. **Install rclone** - `bm cloud setup`
3. **Add projects with sync** - `bm project add research --cloud --local-path ~/Documents/research`

**Personal workspace (solo, mirror) workflow:**

4. **Preview first sync** - `bm cloud bisync --name research --resync --dry-run`
5. **Establish baseline** - `bm cloud bisync --name research --resync`
6. **Daily workflow** - `bm cloud bisync --name research`

**Team workspace (shared, additive) workflow:**

4. **Fetch teammates' changes** - `bm cloud pull --name research`
5. **Upload your changes** - `bm cloud push --name research`
6. **Resolve conflicts explicitly** - re-run with `--on-conflict keep-cloud|keep-local|keep-both`

**Key benefits:**
- ✅ Each project independently syncs (or doesn't)
- ✅ Projects can live anywhere on disk
- ✅ Explicit sync operations (no magic)
- ✅ Team-safe push/pull that never delete on the destination
- ✅ Safe by design (max delete limits, conflict resolution, git-style conflict aborts)
- ✅ Full offline access (work locally, sync when ready)

**Future enhancements:**
- `--all` flag to sync all configured projects
- Project list showing sync status
- Watch mode for automatic sync
