# Basic Memory Domain Model

This document defines Basic Memory's product language, ownership, identity, and source-of-truth
rules. [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) describes code layers and dependency direction;
[ENGINEERING_STYLE.md](ENGINEERING_STYLE.md) describes how to implement changes. This document
describes what the system's concepts mean and which invariants the code must preserve.

## Design Center

Basic Memory gives humans and agents one canonical representation for note knowledge: Markdown.
Other resources may be addressable, but structured note and graph semantics are derived from
Markdown without making the resulting projections a competing source of knowledge.

Use domain terms in names, types, APIs, tests, and documentation. Do not let a transport DTO,
database table, queue message, or UI state redefine the product concept it represents.

## Core Concepts

### Project

A project is the core knowledge and isolation boundary. Every entity, observation, relation, and
search record belongs to exactly one project.

- A local project maps to a configured directory.
- A hosted workspace or tenant may provide routing, authorization, and storage around a project,
  but `workspace`, `tenant`, and `project` are not interchangeable domain terms.
- Project selection must be explicit or resolved once at an entrypoint. Lower layers receive the
  resolved project context rather than rediscovering global state.

### Note

A note is the user-facing Markdown document. It combines optional YAML frontmatter, prose,
observations, and relations.

- A note is Markdown, not a database row or editor view.
- `EntityMarkdown` is the parsed boundary representation of a note.
- A Markdown note maps to one project-scoped entity. An entity is broader than a note because the
  resource model can also represent non-Markdown content.

Use `note` in user-facing APIs and flows that specifically operate on Markdown. Use `entity` when
code genuinely operates on the broader indexed resource model.

### Entity

An entity is the project-scoped indexed representation of one file or resource. It is the node to
which graph and search projections attach.

- `id` is an internal database identity.
- `external_id` is the stable external/API identity and must survive ordinary updates and moves.
- `file_path` is the current project-relative storage location. It is unique within a project and
  may change when the resource moves.
- `permalink` is the required human/agent-facing semantic address for Markdown content. It is
  project-scoped and changes only according to the configured move and permalink policies.
- Non-Markdown entities always have `permalink=None`. `external_id` is their stable API identity,
  and `file_path` locates the stored resource; a database-only permalink would not round-trip
  through the source file.
- `title` is mutable display metadata, not identity.
- For Markdown notes, `created_at` and `updated_at` project the canonical `created` and `modified`
  frontmatter values. Missing values fall back independently to file ctime and mtime for legacy
  notes; invalid canonical values fail indexing.
- `checksum`, `mtime`, size, and path describe the physical file used for synchronization. They
  are bookkeeping, not note semantics, and moves or materialization must not overwrite semantic
  timestamps.
- Parsed metadata and indexed text describe synchronized state; they are not independent
  knowledge sources.

### Resolution Contracts

Project-scoped entity resolution treats the route project as the target. It may use a source path
to disambiguate notes inside that project, but it must never return an entity owned by another
project.

Source-aware wikilink resolution treats the route project as the source/default context. A
qualified reference may select another target project, and the response names that target project
explicitly. Hosted callers must authorize the target project separately; authorization of the
source project does not grant access to the resolved target.

### Observation

An observation is a categorized semantic statement owned by one source entity. It contains
content and may carry category, context, and tags.

- An observation belongs to the same project as its entity.
- Its durable representation is the observation syntax in the source note.
- The database row and search document are projections rebuilt when the note is parsed.
- An observation has no independent lifecycle outside its source entity.

### Relation

A relation is a directed semantic statement owned by its source entity.

- `from_id` identifies the source entity that contains the relation.
- `relation_type` names the meaning of the edge.
- `to_id` identifies the resolved target when it exists.
- `to_name` preserves the author's target text even while the relation is unresolved.
- Source and resolved target belong to the same project graph.
- The durable representation is the relation syntax in the source note. Resolution enriches that
  statement; it does not replace it.

Incoming graph navigation does not transfer ownership to the target. Re-indexing the source note
may recreate, resolve, or remove its outgoing relations.

Deleting the target is not one of those events. When a target entity is deleted, its inbound
relations survive with `to_id` cleared and `to_name` intact -- the same unresolved state the
indexer produces for a link to a note that does not exist yet. The source note's markdown still
carries the reference, so the graph must keep carrying it too; a graph that quietly drops the edge
reports a clean bill of health over a broken link. Forward-reference resolution re-links the row
if the target is ever recreated.

### NoteContent

`NoteContent` is the operational record of accepted Markdown bytes and their file materialization
state for one note entity. It is not a second note or a separate product concept.

- `markdown_content`, `db_version`, and `db_checksum` identify the accepted content version.
- `file_version` and `file_checksum` identify the version materialized to storage.
- `file_write_status` records whether materialization is pending, writing, synchronized, failed,
  or blocked by an external change.
- A note entity has at most one current `NoteContent` record.

Use this model to coordinate DB-first acceptance, retries, conflict detection, and read repair.
Do not let materialization mechanics leak into ordinary note or entity APIs unless callers need to
reason about acceptance or synchronization status.

### Search And Graph Indexes

Full-text rows, vector embeddings, chunks, observation rows, and relation rows are derived
projections. They exist to retrieve and traverse knowledge efficiently.

- A projection may lag an accepted write during asynchronous work.
- A projection must be rebuildable or reconcilable from canonical Markdown state.
- Search results point back to entities and notes; they do not become independent documents.
- Deleting or rebuilding an index must not mutate canonical content.

### Accepted Change Journal

`RuntimeAcceptedProjectNoteChange` is the canonical temporal record of one accepted note mutation
inside a project partition, and `Project.partition_position` is the strictly ordered per-project
watermark those records advance.

- An accepted change is replay-complete evidence: operation, paths, accepted content version and
  checksum, actor, source, and acceptance time. It is recorded with the accepted mutation, not
  reconstructed later from derived state.
- Consumers that need ordering, coalescing, or idempotency — projectors, routines, temporal
  reads — consume the journal watermark. Human-facing feeds are presentations, never the
  ordering substrate; today's recent-activity feed still derives from search state rather than
  journal reads (see Event Surfaces And Derivation).
- Materialization settling records when durable storage caught up with an accepted position. A
  consumer that must not run ahead of durable files (the Wiki Projector, portable logs) holds
  behind unsettled positions instead of guessing.
- The journal is note-scoped and project-partitioned today. A fuller event envelope (causation,
  correlation, depth, workspace scope) grows this record; it does not introduce a second journal
  beside it.
- Scope today: only DB-first accepted note mutations reach the journal
  (`accepted_note_mutation_runner`). File-first reconciliation — observed file indexing and
  external delete handling — converges derived state without journal evidence yet. Journaling
  those reconciliation paths is the intended direction; until it lands, journal consumers see
  DB-first mutations only, and file-first changes surface through reindex and reconciliation.

### Event Surfaces And Derivation

Every event-shaped surface is the journal, a projection of it, ingress toward it, or a separate
family that must not be mistaken for it:

```text
storage notifications / webhooks          ingress evidence
  -> reconciliation commands
    -> accepted change journal            canonical time
         -> wiki projections              index.md, log.md, navigation
         -> search / graph / vector       retrieval projections
         -> activity feeds, live updates  human presentation and transient delivery
         -> temporal reads (bm log)       CLI/API views over the journal
```

- A projection may lag the journal and must be rebuildable from it plus canonical Markdown.
- The diagram is the target architecture; two edges run ahead of the code today. Ingress:
  reconciliation of external file changes does not yet advance the journal (see the journal's
  scope bullet above), so the top edge holds only for DB-first accepted mutations. Activity:
  the current recent-activity feed is built from search state (`ContextService.build_context`),
  not from journal reads — its edge names where that feed converges, not what it reads today.
- Delivery events (webhook attempts, storage notifications, SSE publishes) prove delivery, not
  acceptance; they are never the canonical semantic log.
- Run ledgers (projection runs, index runs) record operational work, and product telemetry
  (usage, subscription, journey events) records behavior. Neither is a knowledge event, and
  neither derives from the journal.

POSIX-shaped reads describe memory space; the accepted change journal describes time; the
knowledge graph describes meaning; runtimes describe behavior.

## Source Of Truth And Authority

"Markdown is the source of truth" describes the product representation. Operational authority
depends on the write phase and runtime.

### Local File-First Flow

The Markdown file is the durable authority. Direct human edits, CLI writes, and local MCP/API
writes converge on the file. Entity, graph, and search state are reconciled from the bytes that
landed on disk.

### Accepted DB-First Or Cloud-Style Flow

The service derives the final Markdown once and records that exact accepted version in
`NoteContent`. Until materialization finishes, that version is the operational authority for what
the system accepted. A worker or local provider materializes the same bytes to storage, records
the resulting file version and checksum, and publishes the derived graph and search state.

The DB-first accept path does not create a proprietary document model: the accepted value is still
Markdown, and materialization produces the portable file representation.

### Project Registry Authority

Project discovery differs by runtime. Local flows reconcile configured projects with the local
database; hosted flows may receive project and workspace context from the database or control
plane. Resolve that authority at the composition root or project service. Do not make repositories
or leaf helpers guess which registry wins.

## Write And Reconciliation Flows

### Create Or Update

1. Resolve the project and validate the boundary request.
2. Derive final frontmatter, permalink behavior, path, and Markdown bytes without mutating the
   caller's input.
3. Parse the accepted Markdown once into its entity, observations, and relations.
4. Persist the same parsed semantic timestamps through the runtime's file-first or DB-first path.
5. Reconcile the entity and its owned graph projections.
6. Update search projections from the same accepted or materialized content.
7. Resolve pending relation targets after the target entities exist.

Do not independently rebuild Markdown in multiple layers. Preparation, persistence, response, and
indexing must agree on the accepted bytes.

### External File Change

1. Detect the changed project-relative path.
2. Read and parse the file that now owns the local truth.
3. Upsert the entity while preserving stable external identity.
4. Replace the source entity's observations and outgoing relations from the parsed note.
5. Refresh search projections and relation resolution.

### Move

A move changes `file_path`. It preserves `external_id`, updates storage atomically, and applies the
configured permalink policy. Code that handles a move must keep frontmatter, entity state,
materialization state, graph links, and search records coherent.

### Delete

A delete removes canonical content through the service that owns the storage boundary, then
removes or reconciles its derived entity, graph, materialization, and search state. A caller must
not delete only a projection and report that the note was deleted.

## Boundary Vocabulary

- Use **schema** or **request/response model** for Pydantic transport and validation types.
- Use **model** with a qualifier when ambiguity matters: domain value, persistence model, parsed
  Markdown model, or runtime payload.
- Use **repository** for database access, not business decisions or file writes.
- Use **service** for domain operations that coordinate repositories, files, and projections.
- Use **client** for typed communication across an API boundary.
- Use **materialization** for writing accepted Markdown to durable file storage.
- Use **indexing** for producing retrieval state from content.
- Use **synchronization** or **reconciliation** for bringing canonical content and projections
  back into agreement.

Avoid generic names such as `manager`, `handler`, `data`, `item`, or `record` when the domain term
is known.

## Domain Change Checklist

Before adding a model, abstraction, or workflow, answer:

1. Which domain concept owns this behavior or state?
2. What is the canonical representation at this point in the lifecycle?
3. Which identifier is stable, and which locations or labels may change?
4. Is this value a domain concept, a boundary schema, persistence state, or a derived projection?
5. Which project, workspace, or tenant boundary constrains it?
6. Can the code express the operation with functions and typed values before introducing another
   service, hierarchy, or registry?
7. Which test proves the invariant across file, database, graph, search, and API surfaces?
