# Manual Pages

Basic Memory's manual is written in the style of Unix man pages — and
implemented as Basic Memory notes ([#952](https://github.com/basicmachines-co/basic-memory/issues/952)).
Every page is a markdown note conforming to the `Manpage` schema, `SEE ALSO`
entries are real knowledge-graph relations, and every example on every page
was executed against a live project before the page shipped. The manual
documents the tools; the tools verify the manual.

## Where it lives

Section 3 — one page per MCP tool — is canonical **in the package**, at
`src/basic_memory/man/man3/`, so every install ships the same pages: local,
cloud, or offline. The MCP server serves them as resources (`memory://man`
is the index, `memory://man/search-notes(3)` a page) and `bm man <topic>`
prints one in a shell. The `manual` project in the Basic Memory team
workspace (cloud, shared) holds the full manual — sections 5 and 7 are
canonical there — and anyone can build their own: the schema ships as an
opt-in seed at `plugins/claude-code/schemas/manpage.md` — copy it into any
project's folder and start writing pages against it.

Layout:

```
manual/
├── schemas/Manpage.md      # the manpage schema (type: schema)
├── man1/                   # CLI commands        bm(1), bm-status(1), ...
├── man3/                   # MCP tools           write-note(3), search-notes(3), ...
├── man5/                   # file formats        bm-note(5), bm-observation(5), ...
├── man7/                   # concepts            basic-memory(7), semantic-memory(7), ...
├── playground/             # scratch notes for destructive examples
└── diagrams/               # canvas visualizations of the manual graph
```

### Why "man1", "man3", "man5"?

The folder names are Unix's, unchanged since 1971. The manual is divided
into numbered **sections**, pages physically live in directories named
after them (`/usr/share/man/man1`, `man5`, ...), and the number tells you
what *kind* of thing is documented — not importance, not reading order:

- **1** — user commands (`ls`, `grep`)
- **2** — system calls
- **3** — library functions / APIs (`printf(3)`)
- **4** — devices
- **5** — file formats and config files (`crontab(5)`, `passwd(5)`)
- **6** — games (really)
- **7** — miscellanea: concepts, conventions, overviews (`regex(7)`, `signal(7)`)
- **8** — system administration

That's also why man page names carry the parenthesized number —
`crontab(1)` is the command, `crontab(5)` is the file format, same name in
two sections. `man 5 crontab` picks the section explicitly.

This manual copies that layout with the sections that have a Basic Memory
analog:

- **man1/** — `bm` CLI commands → `bm-status(1)`
- **man3/** — MCP tools, our equivalent of the "library API" section → `write-note(3)`
- **man5/** — file formats: note syntax, observations, relations, schemas → `bm-note(5)`
- **man7/** — concepts → `basic-memory(7)`, `semantic-memory(7)`
- **8** is reserved for admin/cloud operations but has no pages yet; 2, 4,
  and 6 have no analog (no system calls, no devices, and no games — yet)

When a page says `see_also [[bm-note(5)]]`, the `(5)` reads "the
file-format page," exactly the way a Unix manual cross-references — except
here it's a traversable relation in the graph instead of a typographic
convention. The manual explains its own conventions in `man-pages(7)` —
fittingly, the same page name Linux uses for this, and that almost nobody
ever reads.

## Page anatomy

Pages use the classic headers where applicable: `NAME`, `SYNOPSIS`,
`DESCRIPTION`, `PARAMETERS`, `MCP USAGE`, `CLI EQUIVALENT`, `EXAMPLES`,
`GOTCHAS`, `SEE ALSO`. Frontmatter (validated by the schema):

```yaml
type: manpage
section: 3                      # 1 | 3 | 5 | 7 | 8
name: write-note                # page name without section suffix
summary: create or overwrite a markdown note in the knowledge base
generated: hand                 # hand | registry | cli  (regeneration ownership)
tool: write_note                # section-3 pages: the MCP tool documented
command: basic-memory status    # section-1 pages: the CLI command documented
verified: 0.21.6 mcp+cli        # version + path(s) that proved the page
```

Field knowledge accumulates as observations — `[gotcha]`, `[bug]` (with issue
links), `[pattern]` — and `SEE ALSO` entries are `see_also` relations, so the
manual is a navigable graph, not a folder of files.

## How to use it

Man-style reads (any MCP client or the CLI):

```bash
# read a page
bm tool read-note "man3/write-note-3" --project manual

# apropos — find pages by section, tool, or text
bm tool search-notes --project manual          # then filter, or via MCP:
#   search_notes(project="manual", metadata_filters={"type": "manpage", "section": 3})
#   search_notes(project="manual", metadata_filters={"type": "manpage", "tool": "write_note"})

# traverse SEE ALSO from any page
#   build_context(url="man3/write-note-3", project="manual")
```

From an MCP client, the same pages are resources — no project required:

```
memory://man                      # the index (apropos)
memory://man/search-notes(3)      # one page
memory://man/3/search-notes       # any common spelling resolves,
memory://man/search_notes         # including the tool name itself
```

And in a shell, `bm man search-notes` prints the page as Markdown and
`bm man list` lists every page with its summary.

And for the real thing — `man bm` in an actual terminal:

```bash
bm man install        # copies bundled groff pages to ~/.local/share/man
man bm                # the overview page, rendered by man(1)
man basic-memory      # same page via its alias
```

`bm man install` warns with a one-line `MANPATH` fix if the install root
isn't searched by your `man`. Agents with shell access can use `man bm` as
an offline quick reference; the full per-tool detail stays in the manual
project's section-3 pages.

## The verification discipline

Two rules make the manual trustworthy:

1. **Examples must have run.** An `EXAMPLES` (or `MCP USAGE` / `CLI
   EQUIVALENT`) block contains only commands that actually executed against
   the manual project. Destructive operations (`delete_note`, `move_note`,
   destructive `edit_note`) run only against `playground/` notes — never
   against pages. The `verified:` field records the version and which path
   proved the page: `mcp` (live service), `cli` (dev checkout), or both.

2. **The schema is the linter.** Validate the whole manual any time:

   ```bash
   bm tool schema-validate manpage --project manual
   # → {"total_notes": 38, "valid_count": 38, "warning_count": 0, ...}
   ```

   `bm orphans --project manual` confirms every page is connected to the
   graph, and `schema_diff`/`schema_infer` report drift between the schema
   and how pages are actually written.

Because verification exercises real tool calls against the live service,
building the manual doubles as an end-to-end smoke test. The initial build
found six bugs in one pass (#954–#959) — including the verification rule
catching a test that asserted a bug as expected output (#958).

## Adding or updating a page

1. Run the commands you intend to document; keep the actual output.
2. Write the page with `write_note`, passing frontmatter through the
   `metadata` parameter (nested YAML in content frontmatter is unreliable on
   some clients):

   ```
   write_note(title="my-tool(3)", directory="man3", project="manual",
              note_type="manpage",
              metadata={"section": 3, "name": "my-tool",
                        "summary": "...", "generated": "hand",
                        "tool": "my_tool", "verified": "<version> mcp"})
   ```

3. Link related pages in `SEE ALSO` with `see_also [[other-page(3)]]`.
   Forward references to pages that don't exist yet are fine — they resolve
   automatically when the target is written.
4. Validate: `bm tool schema-validate manpage --project manual`.

For mechanical updates to generated sections, prefer `edit_note` with
`replace_section` / `insert_after_section` so curated content (EXAMPLES,
GOTCHAS, SEE ALSO, observations) survives — that ownership split is what the
`generated:` field declares.

## Roadmap

- **Registry generator (section 3: shipped)** — `just man-regen` renders every
  section-3 MCP SYNOPSIS and PARAMETERS block from the live tool registry and a
  test holds the shipped blocks byte-equal to the rendering, so a tool change
  without a regenerate fails CI. Those pages declare `generated: registry`.
- **CLI generator (section 1: shipped)** — the same `just man-regen` renders
  every section-1 shell SYNOPSIS and OPTIONS block from the Typer command tree
  (aliases and paired booleans included, and the full option list, shared and
  routing flags included), held byte-equal by a drift test. Those pages declare
  `generated: cli`. Curated sections stay hand-owned; the hand-written corpus
  remains the template spec for everything else.
- **Projects as consumers** — `bm man install --project <name>` copies the
  bundled pages into a project as notes, so `SEE ALSO` becomes traversable
  relations and the pages join search. (`bm man <topic>`, `bm man list`, the
  `memory://man` resources, and the bundled section 3 already ship — the
  second slice of [#610](https://github.com/basicmachines-co/basic-memory/issues/610).)
- **Groff for section 3** — render the bundled pages to roff so
  `man search-notes` works after `bm man install`, alongside `bm.1`.
- **Docs site** — the notes remain canonical for sections 5 and 7, code is
  canonical for 1 and 3; both render to the hosted docs site.
