"""Integration tests for CONCURRENT write_note MCP operations.

The write path is guarded by a FileService semaphore and race handling in the
entity_service, but the suite previously had no integration coverage that
actually drives multiple writes at once through the full stack
(MCP Client -> MCP Server -> FastAPI -> Database). These tests exercise that
concurrency to prove writes do not clobber each other, permalinks stay unique,
the search index stays consistent, and reads remain coherent while writes are
in flight. Concurrency matters here because real clients (multiple agents,
watch-driven syncs) can issue overlapping writes, and a lost update or a
corrupted index would silently drop knowledge.

Every test uses ``output_format="json"`` so assertions read structured fields
(``action``, ``permalink``, ``error``, ``content``) instead of scraping human
markdown. Each test is fully self-contained and runs on its own
function-scoped event loop, matching the repo convention (plain
``@pytest.mark.asyncio``) so a bare ``pytest`` invocation passes with no
``-o`` loop scope override.

    The MCP local-ASGI client caches one ``asyncio.Lock`` per FastAPI app in a
    module-level dict (``async_client._prepared_local_asgi_database_prepare_locks``)
    to serialize first-request DB preparation. That lock binds to whichever event
    loop first acquires it. Under this module's heavy concurrent writes a request
    can still hold the lock when the MCP server task is cancelled at test
    teardown, leaving it LOCKED and bound to that test's (now-closed) loop; the
    next function-scoped test then fails its first call with
    ``RuntimeError: <Lock ...> is bound to a different event loop``.

    Clearing the cache around each test forces a fresh lock on the current loop,
    which lets these tests run on plain function-scoped loops (the repo default in
    pyproject) under a bare ``pytest`` with no override. The prepared-database
    cache self-empties via the
