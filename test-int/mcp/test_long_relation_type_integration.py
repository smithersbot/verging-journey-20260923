"""Integration test for long prose before inline wikilinks.

Issue #721 was originally triggered by markdown bullets that contained inline
`[[wikilinks]]` preceded by long prose. The parser treated all prose before the
wikilink as `relation_type`, and the response model's former `MaxLen(200)`
constraint caused edit_note to fail with:

    1 validation error for EntityResponseV2
    relations.0.relation_type
      String should have at most 200 characters

The relation grammar now fixes the root ambiguity too: unquoted multi-word
prefixes are prose, so this shape should index as a generic `links_to`
relation rather than preserving prose as a custom relation type.
