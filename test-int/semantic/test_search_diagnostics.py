"""Diagnostic tests for semantic search quality issues.

These tests isolate specific problems with the search pipeline:
1. Similarity score compression — cosine distances map to a narrow similarity band
2. Observation noise — context-free observations match too broadly
3. Hybrid fusion behavior — how FTS and vector scores interact
4. Min-similarity threshold effectiveness
